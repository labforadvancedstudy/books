# NPC (Non-Player Character)

## Core Insight
The illusion of others in solitary worlds - where algorithms wear masks of personality to populate digital loneliness.

NPCs are gaming's background actors. They sell items, give quests, populate towns, create the illusion that the world exists beyond the player. Yet they're loops of code, waiting to deliver their lines. "I used to be an adventurer like you..."

The tragedy of NPCs: they exist only for the player. Their shops never close. Their problems never resolve without player intervention. They stand in place for eternity, waiting to dispense their single piece of dialogue. They are Sisyphus, but their boulder is a conversation tree.

Yet we grow attached. We remember NPCs who made us laugh, who died tragically, who felt real despite their obvious artificiality. In their scripted responses, we find humanity - not theirs, but ours, reflected.
