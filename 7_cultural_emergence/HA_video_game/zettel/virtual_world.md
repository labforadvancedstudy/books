# Virtual World

## Core Insight
Consensus reality built from bits - where collective belief transforms data structures into places with history, meaning, and consequence.

A virtual world isn't just graphics and physics. It's a space where events matter to people. Where relationships form. Where economies emerge. Where cultures develop. World of Warcraft isn't code - it's a place where millions have lived parts of their lives.

The magic ingredient: persistence plus population. When changes last and others witness them, space becomes place. When actions have consequences that ripple through time and community, games become worlds.

Virtual worlds ask: what makes a place real? Is it matter or meaning? If people live, love, and labor somewhere, isn't it real regardless of its substrate?
