# Ludonarrative

## Core Insight
The marriage of mechanics and meaning - where what you do and why you do it achieve rare harmony or painful dissonance.

Ludonarrative harmony: when gameplay reinforces story. Dark Souls' difficulty IS the narrative of struggle. Papers, Please makes bureaucracy the mechanic and the message. The playing tells the story better than cutscenes could.

Ludonarrative dissonance: when gameplay contradicts story. The heroic archaeologist who murders hundreds. The pacifist character in a game about killing. The urgent mission you can ignore for 50 hours of side quests. The mechanics mock the meaning.

This tension reveals gaming's dual nature. Games want to be stories, but stories aren't interactive. Games want player agency, but agency breaks narrative. The greatest games resolve this paradox not by choosing sides, but by making the tension itself meaningful.
