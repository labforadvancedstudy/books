# Digital Identity

## Core Insight
The self, multiplied and distributed across virtual worlds - where identity becomes performance and avatars become aspects of soul.

Who are you in a game? Your avatar isn't you, yet it is. When someone kills your character, you say "they killed me." When your character speaks, you say "I said." The boundary blurs. The identification is real.

Gamers maintain multiple identities across multiple worlds. A healer in WoW. A soldier in CoD. A city-builder in Minecraft. Each identity has its own reputation, relationships, history. Which is more real - the physical body or the digital selves that consume more waking hours?

Digital identity raises ancient questions in new forms: what is the self? Can identity be multiple? If millions know your avatar but not your face, which is your true face?
