# Multiplayer

## Core Insight
The end of solipsism in digital worlds - where games became social spaces and other minds entered our private universes.

Single-player games are dreams - private experiences between player and machine. Multiplayer games are shared hallucinations. When another player enters your game, everything changes. The AI becomes human. The predictable becomes chaotic. The game becomes a place.

From split-screen to LAN parties to global matchmaking - multiplayer's evolution is the story of collapsing distance. Two players, one screen. Four players, one room. Millions of players, one world. Each leap required new solutions to ancient problems: how do we synchronize realities? How do we handle cheating? How do we manage conflict?

Multiplayer revealed a truth: games aren't just about mechanics. They're about the spaces between minds.
