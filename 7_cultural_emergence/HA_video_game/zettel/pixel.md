# Pixel

## Core Insight
The atomic unit of digital visual representation - where discrete mathematics meets human perception.

A pixel (picture element) is the smallest controllable element of a digital image. It's the quantum of the digital visual world - indivisible, discrete, yet combining to create the illusion of continuous reality.

In early video games, pixels were precious. Each one mattered. Designers had to convey entire worlds with grids of colored squares. This constraint birthed an aesthetic - pixel art - that persists even in our age of photorealism.

The pixel teaches us: complexity emerges from simplicity. Mario's face is just 12x16 colored dots, yet we see personality, emotion, life.
