# Play

## Core Insight
The fundamental human activity that predates culture - where learning disguises itself as joy and evolution masquerades as fun.

Play is older than civilization. Animals play. Children play before they speak. Play is how mammals learn to mammal. But human play transcends survival training. We play with ideas, with identity, with impossibility. We play for play's sake.

Games are play with rules. But play itself is ruleless, purposeless, autotelic - its own reward. The magic of games is how they channel formless play into structured experience without killing the playfulness. Too many rules, play dies. Too few rules, play dissipates.

Digital games revealed new dimensions of play. We can play with physics without consequences. Play with death without dying. Play with identity without commitment. Play with time itself. Games didn't invent play - they expanded its possibility space infinitely.
