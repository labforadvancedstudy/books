# Game Streaming

## Core Insight
Playing as performance art - where games transformed from private experience to public spectacle, and watching became its own form of play.

Twitch turned gaming inside out. The private became public. The player became performer. The game became stage. Millions watch others play - not for the game, but for the player. Personality trumps skill. Commentary creates narrative. Chat creates community.

This isn't passive consumption. It's participatory spectacle. Viewers influence play through donations, suggestions, memes. They're not watching someone play a game - they're part of a collective experience that happens to involve a game.

Streaming revealed a truth: games were always social, even single-player ones. We just lacked the technology to share the experience in real-time. Now every game is potentially multiplayer - not through code, but through culture.
