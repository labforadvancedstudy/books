# Save Game

## Core Insight
Digital memory external to the machine - where games learned to remember across the void of power-off.

Before saves, every game was Sisyphean. Progress meant nothing. Switch off, start over. The password system was our first rebellion against this eternal reset - encoding entire game states into strings of characters.

Then came battery-backed RAM. Suddenly, games could remember. Your journey persisted. Link's adventure continued. This wasn't just technical innovation - it was narrative revolution. Games could tell stories that spanned days, weeks, months.

The save game created investment. It transformed games from diversions into worlds we inhabit. Delete someone's save file - watch them mourn as if something real was lost. Because something real WAS lost: time crystallized into data.
