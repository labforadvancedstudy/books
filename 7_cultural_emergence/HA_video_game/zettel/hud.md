# HUD (Heads-Up Display)

## Core Insight
The fourth wall made functional - where game state becomes visual overlay, turning players into cyborgs with data vision.

The HUD is gaming's great compromise. Games strive for immersion, yet players need information. Health bars float in space. Ammo counts hover in corners. Minimaps reveal god's-eye views. The HUD breaks immersion to enable play.

Evolution of HUD design mirrors gaming's maturation. Early games: HUD as afterthought. Modern games: HUD as art. Some games hide it entirely (Dead Space's holographic displays). Others make it diegetic (Metro's watch and clipboard). The best HUDs disappear until needed.

The HUD asks: how much should players know? Total information enables strategy but reduces tension. No information creates immersion but causes frustration. Every HUD is a philosophy about the relationship between player and game.
