## Core Insight
Digital athletics where reflexes meet strategy - the transformation of play into profession, hobby into spectacle.

Esports inverted gaming's promise. Games sold escape from reality; esports made gaming into serious reality. Training regimens. Team houses. Coaches, analysts, psychologists. Million-dollar prizes. Sponsorship deals. Retirement at 25.

What legitimizes digital competition? The same thing that legitimizes any sport: audiences. Millions watch League of Legends championships. They understand the skill, feel the tension, celebrate the victories. The ball is virtual, but the competition is real.

Esports asks fundamental questions: what separates sport from game? Is physicality necessary, or is mental contest sufficient? When teenagers earn millions playing video games professionally, what does that say about value, labor, and play?
