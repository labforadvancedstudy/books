# Magic Circle

## Core Insight
The invisible boundary between game and life - where different rules apply and ordinary morality suspends.

Step into a game, and you enter the magic circle. Inside, it's okay to kill, to steal, to lie. Not just okay - required. The magic circle is agreement: within this space and time, we play by different rules. What's crime outside is strategy inside.

But the circle is permeable. Real money buys virtual goods. Virtual relationships become real friendships. Game skills become job qualifications. The membrane between game and life grows thinner.

The magic circle is humanity's laboratory for consequence-free experimentation. What if we could fly? What if death wasn't permanent? What if we could be anyone? Games let us ask "what if?" safely. But increasingly, the experiments escape the lab.
