# Level Design

## Core Insight
Architecture as teacher - where space itself becomes instructor, guiding players through lessons disguised as environments.

Great level design is invisible pedagogy. That first Goomba in Mario 1-1 teaches jumping. The pit teaches consequences. The pipe teaches exploration. No tutorial needed - the level IS the tutorial. Space structured to teach through experience.

Level designers are psychological architects. They control flow through geometry, emotion through lighting, difficulty through enemy placement. Every corner turned should reveal something: a vista, a challenge, a choice. Predictability kills engagement; surprise sustains it.

The paradox: good level design feels natural while being completely artificial. Players should feel like pathfinders while following the designer's invisible hand. Too linear, and players feel railroaded. Too open, and they feel lost. The sweet spot is guided freedom.
