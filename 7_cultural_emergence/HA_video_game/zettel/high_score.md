# High Score

## Core Insight
Three words that transformed play into performance - the birth of competitive gaming and digital legacy.

Before high scores, games were experiences. After high scores, games became contests. Those three letters - AAA, or your initials - were your mark upon the machine. Proof you existed. Proof you excelled.

High scores created persistence in ephemeral media. Arcade machines remembered. Your achievement outlasted your quarter. In those LED digits lay the seeds of achievements, leaderboards, esports - every system that transforms play into measurable performance.

The high score asks: is play valuable only when measured? Does quantification enhance or diminish joy?
