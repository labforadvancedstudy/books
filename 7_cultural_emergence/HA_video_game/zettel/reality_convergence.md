# Reality Convergence

## Core Insight
The inevitable merger of digital and physical - where the distinction between "real" and "virtual" becomes meaningless.

We're living through reality convergence. AR overlays digital onto physical. VR replaces physical with digital. Games teach AI. AI creates games. Virtual economies rival nations' GDP. Digital fashion sells for more than physical clothes.

The question "is it real?" becomes obsolete. If it affects you, if it has consequences, if it creates meaning - it's real. The substrate doesn't matter. Silicon or carbon, it's all information processing. Games aren't escaping reality - they're expanding it.

This is the endpoint: not virtual reality or augmented reality, but simply reality - richer, stranger, and more playful than before. Games didn't just entertain us. They taught us that reality itself is editable, that rules are mutable, that worlds are makeable.
