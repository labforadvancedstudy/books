# Input Lag

## Core Insight
The temporal gap between intention and action - where the immediacy of thought meets the physics of information transfer.

Press button. Wait. See result. In that wait lies frustration or responsiveness. Input lag is the sum of all delays: controller processing, USB polling, CPU cycles, GPU rendering, display refresh. Milliseconds that feel like eternities.

Fighting game players measure it in frames. Speedrunners optimize for it. Casual players feel it as "sluggishness" or "tightness." It's the difference between feeling like you ARE Mario versus feeling like you're CONTROLLING Mario.

Input lag reminds us: even in digital worlds, information takes time. There is no instant. Every action crosses a chain of transformations, each adding its small delay. The best games hide this. The worst games reveal it.
