# Game Loop

## Core Insight
The heartbeat of interactive worlds - an infinite cycle of sense, think, act that transforms static code into living experience.

```
while (game_running) {
    process_input();
    update_world();
    render_frame();
}
```

This simple pattern is the fundamental rhythm of every video game. Like a heart pumping blood, the game loop pumps interactivity. 30 times per second, 60 times per second - each cycle a discrete moment of existence in the digital realm.

The game loop reveals a profound truth: video games are not things, they are processes. They exist only in their execution, in the cycling of the loop. Stop the loop, and there is no game - only data.
