# Respawn

## Core Insight
Death without consequence - gaming's gift to humanity, where failure becomes iteration and mortality becomes minor inconvenience.

Respawning inverted death's meaning. In life, death is final. In games, it's punctuation. You die, you respawn, you try again. Death becomes teacher, not terminator. This seemingly simple mechanic revolutionized how we think about failure.

Different games treat respawn differently. Dark Souls: you lose souls, enemies reset. Call of Duty: instant return to action. Minecraft: rush back to collect your items. Each system creates different relationships with virtual mortality.

Respawning teaches resilience. It normalizes failure as part of success. Every death is data. Every respawn is hypothesis testing. Games taught a generation that falling down isn't falling behind - it's learning to jump better.
