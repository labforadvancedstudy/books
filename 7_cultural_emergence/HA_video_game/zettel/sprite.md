# Sprite

## Core Insight
A moveable graphic object that taught computers to animate - the first digital actor on the electronic stage.

Sprites were revolution disguised as technique. Before sprites, changing an image meant redrawing everything. Sprites introduced object-thinking to graphics: independent entities that could move without disturbing their surroundings.

The sprite is conceptually profound - it separates actor from stage, figure from ground. In hardware, special circuits moved these pixel patterns independently. In software, they became the ancestors of every game object, every entity, every actor in our digital dramas.

Mario is a sprite. Pac-Man is a sprite. Every enemy, every power-up - sprites all. They taught us to think of game worlds as collections of independent, interacting entities.
