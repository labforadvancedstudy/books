# Fiction

## Core Insight
Fiction is organized lying that tells deeper truths - the paradox of creating false people in false situations to reveal real insights about existence that factual reporting cannot reach.

"It's all made up" misses the point entirely. Fiction operates by different rules than reality but stricter rules than lies. Characters must be psychologically consistent. Plot must follow cause and effect. The world must obey its own logic. Break these rules and readers revolt - they'll accept dragons but not inconsistent dragons.

Fiction writers play god with constraints. They create universes but must make them believable. They know everything about their characters but must reveal information as if discovering it. They manipulate reader emotions while making it seem natural. It's the most elaborate con game, where being fooled is the point.

Why do we cry over characters who never existed? Why do we worry about outcomes already determined? Fiction hijacks our social cognition - the same circuits that track real people activate for fictional ones. We can't help but care. The mind doesn't distinguish "real" from "vividly imagined" at the emotional level.

Every fiction contains the author's philosophy, whether intended or not. What they consider possible, how they believe people work, what they think matters - all embedded in plot choices, character decisions, narrative focus. Fiction is argument disguised as entertainment, worldview smuggled in through story.

The fiction/nonfiction divide is itself fiction. Memoirs select and shape. History interprets. Journalism frames. Meanwhile, novels often contain more psychological truth than psychology textbooks. The boundary exists for library classification, not for truth-seeking. All writing is partially fiction - memory fills gaps, language shapes reality, perspective limits vision.
