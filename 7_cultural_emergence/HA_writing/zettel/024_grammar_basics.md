# Grammar Basics

## Core Insight
Grammar is the operating system of language - invisible rules that let infinite meanings run on finite structures, enabling strangers to decode each other's thoughts through shared conventions.

Children absorb grammar without instruction. By age five, they're creating sentences they've never heard, following rules they can't articulate. "I goed to the store" shows they've extracted the past-tense pattern and applied it logically. Grammar lives deeper than consciousness - we know it before we know we know it.

The basics seem simple: subjects do things to objects. Verbs show action or being. Adjectives modify nouns, adverbs modify everything else. But complexity emerges quickly. Why do we say "big red car" not "red big car"? Native speakers know instantly, but explaining why requires linguistics degrees.

Grammar is cultural DNA. English demands subject-verb-object: "Dog bites man." Japanese prefers subject-object-verb: "Dog man bites." Russian can scramble order because case endings show who's biting whom. Each grammar creates different thought patterns, different ways of seeing cause and effect.

Prescriptive grammar - the rules teachers enforce - often conflicts with descriptive grammar - how people actually talk and write. "Don't split infinitives" comes from Latin-envying 18th-century grammarians. "To boldly go" splits perfectly well. Living language laughs at rulebooks.

Breaking grammar rules consciously creates effects. Fragments for emphasis. Starting sentences with "And" or "But" for conversational tone. The passive voice gets used when agency needs hiding. Master the rules first, then break them with purpose. Grammar isn't prison - it's the skeleton that lets language dance.
