# Urge to Mark

## Core Insight
Before words, before meaning, there is the irresistible compulsion to leave a trace - the primal need that makes us reach for any tool to inscribe our existence.

Watch a child discover a crayon. First comes the grip, then the drag across surface, then the widening eyes: "I did that!" This is writing's true beginning - not with alphabets or grammar, but with the raw urge to mark the world.

The urge precedes literacy by millennia. Cave painters knew it. Prisoners scratching walls know it. Lovers carving initials in trees know it. The hand wants to move, to leave evidence: I was here. I am. I matter enough to change this surface.

This urge is physical first - a tension in the fingers, an itch in the palm, a restlessness that only making marks can satisfy. Writers describe it: "If I don't write, I feel sick." "The words build up like pressure." "My hands need to move."

Even in our digital age, the urge persists. We tap keyboards, swipe screens, click mice - still making marks, still satisfying that ancient need to inscribe ourselves onto reality.
