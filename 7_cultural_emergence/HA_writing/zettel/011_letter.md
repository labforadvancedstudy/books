# Letter

## Core Insight
A letter is a drawing that carries sound - the most successful technology for freezing speech into visual form, turning the ephemeral vibrations of voice into permanent marks that can speak across centuries.

Look at the letter 'A'. See the mountain peak? The sheltering roof? This wasn't arbitrary - many letters evolved from pictograms. 'A' was once an ox head turned upside down. 'B' was a house. These pictures simplified over millennia into abstract marks, but they still carry whispers of their origins.

Each letter is a small miracle of engineering. Consider 'S' - a sound that exists as a hiss of air between teeth, captured as a snake-like curve. Or 'O' - the shape mouths make when producing the sound, frozen in circular permanence. Form follows function in ways we've forgotten to see.

The 26 soldiers of the English alphabet (or 33 of Cyrillic, or thousands of Chinese characters) are humanity's LEGOs. From just these few shapes, every thought that can be written emerges. Shakespeare's sonnets, shopping lists, love letters, laws - all built from the same tiny inventory.

Children learning letters rediscover their magic. Watch a five-year-old realize that 'B' always makes the same sound, that these squiggles aren't random but reliable. The joy when they first decode a word by themselves - they've cracked the code that makes all other codes possible.

Digital fonts try to disguise their uniformity, but every 'e' in this sentence is identical. Handwriting preserves letter individuality - no two 'e's exactly alike, each carrying trace evidence of the hand that made it, the mood of the moment, the speed of thought.
