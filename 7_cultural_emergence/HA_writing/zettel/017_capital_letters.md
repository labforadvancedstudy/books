# Capital Letters

## Core Insight
Capital letters are the ceremonial dress of the alphabet - larger, grander versions that signal beginnings, importance, and identity, transforming common letters into markers of significance.

A capital letter announces: attention! Something starts here. Every sentence lifts off with one, like a tiny fanfare. After the full stop's silence, the capital letter breaks it with visual volume. It's the alphabet's way of clearing its throat before speaking.

Names wear capitals like crowns. "rose" is a flower; "Rose" is a person. The same letters, but the capital transforms generic into specific, common into proper. This tiny change - making one letter larger - creates identity, personhood, uniqueness. God gets a capital; gods don't. The difference matters.

German capitalizes all Nouns, making every Thing important. English used to, but Democracy simplified. Now we save capitals for what we deem Special: People, Places, Titles, Beginnings. The Politics of capitalization reveal what Cultures value. Some Writers rebel, like e.e. cummings, refusing capitals even for "i" - making smallness a Statement.

WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS SHOUTING. It's aggressive, desperate, or sometimes just a stuck caps lock key. The internet learned this early. all lowercase suggests whispering, casualness, or affectation. Mixed Case For Every Word Looks Like A Headline Or Someone Who Doesn't Understand The Rules.

Acronyms are capital letter symphonies: NASA, FBI, LOL. Each letter stands tall, representing a whole word compressed to initial. It's maximum meaning in minimum space, capitals as compression algorithm.

The capital letter is ceremony in miniature - a tiny ritual that happens hundreds of times in any text, so common we forget its significance until someone breaks the rules.
