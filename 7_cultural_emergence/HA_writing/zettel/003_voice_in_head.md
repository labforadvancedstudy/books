# Voice in Head

## Core Insight
The internal narrator that never stops - this ceaseless stream of words thinking themselves is where writing truly begins, long before any mark is made.

Everyone has it: the voice that narrates your life, argues both sides, rehearses conversations, replays memories with different endings. This isn't thinking ABOUT words - this IS thinking. The voice in your head is consciousness clothing itself in language.

Writers often describe "taking dictation" from this voice. They're not creating words so much as catching them, selecting from the endless stream. The art lies not in generating the voice but in:
- Listening more carefully
- Selecting what matters
- Translating inner speech to outer marks
- Maintaining fidelity to the original

Sometimes the voice is yours. Sometimes it feels foreign - characters speaking, ideas arriving "from nowhere." This is the mystery: where does the voice come from? Are you thinking in words, or are words thinking through you?

The voice pre-writes everything. Every written sentence was first an inner utterance, tested in the private theater of mind before its public debut on page.
