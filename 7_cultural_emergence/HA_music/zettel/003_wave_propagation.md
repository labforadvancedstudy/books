## Core Insight
Sound needs something to travel through - it cannot exist in emptiness.

## Content
Sound waves are pressure variations that propagate through a medium. In air at room temperature, sound travels at approximately 343 meters per second. In water, it's faster - about 1,480 m/s. Through steel, even faster at 5,960 m/s.

This is why there is no sound in space - no medium, no music. It's also why sounds change underwater, why train tracks sing before the train arrives, why thunder follows lightning. The medium shapes the message.
