## Core Insight
Beneath all musical diversity lies a universal grammar - not of rules but of relationships, tensions, and resolutions.

## Content
Every culture creates music, and despite vast surface differences, deep commonalities emerge. Octave equivalence is nearly universal. Discrete pitch sets (scales) appear everywhere. Rhythm organizes around regular pulses. Small integer frequency ratios (2:1, 3:2, 4:3) create consonance cross-culturally.

This suggests music taps into cognitive universals deeper than culture. Just as Chomsky proposed universal grammar for language, music might reveal the universe's grammar - how patterns create meaning, how time creates structure, how vibration creates connection.

The universe itself might be musical - from orbital resonances to quantum harmonics. We don't impose music on reality; we discover reality's inherent musicality.
