## Core Insight
Bach revealed music's mathematical soul - demonstrating that profound emotion could emerge from pure structural logic.

## Content
In Bach's fugues, mathematical transformations become emotional journeys. A theme can be inverted (upside down), retrograded (backwards), augmented (slower), diminished (faster), all while maintaining its identity. The Art of Fugue explores every possible permutation of a single theme.

This isn't cold calculation - it's profound spiritual expression through mathematical means. Bach showed that constraint breeds creativity, that the deepest emotions might emerge from the most rigorous structures. His well-tempered clavier systematically explored all 24 keys, proving equal temperament's viability while creating transcendent art.

Modern algorithmic composition and AI music generation are his direct descendants.
