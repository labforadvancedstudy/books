## Core Insight
The ear is a frequency analyzer, the brain a pattern recognizer - together they create the experience of pitch.

## Content
The cochlea in our inner ear is arranged like a spiral piano keyboard. High frequencies resonate near the entrance, low frequencies deep inside. Hair cells at each location send signals when their frequency is detected.

But pitch isn't just frequency. The brain constructs pitch from multiple cues - fundamental frequency, harmonics, even the gaps between harmonics. This is why we can "hear" a bass note on tiny speakers that can't physically produce that frequency. The brain fills in what's missing.
