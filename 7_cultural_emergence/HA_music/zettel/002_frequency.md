## Core Insight
Frequency is time's gift to sound - how many vibrations happen per second defines what we hear.

## Content
Frequency, measured in Hertz (Hz), counts vibrations per second. Middle C on a piano vibrates at approximately 261.63 Hz. Double the frequency, and you get the same note an octave higher (523.26 Hz).

Humans can hear roughly from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Below 20 Hz, we feel rather than hear. Above 20,000 Hz, the vibrations are there, but our biology cannot detect them. Other animals live in different frequency worlds - elephants communicate in infrasound, dolphins in ultrasound.
