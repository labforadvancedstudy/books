## Core Insight
Rhythm is how consciousness carves time into manageable chunks - creating islands of predictability in temporal chaos.

## Content
The brain is always predicting the next beat. Neural oscillations synchronize to external rhythms, creating internal templates of when events should occur. This is why a skipped beat feels wrong - our prediction was violated.

Groove happens when predictions are fulfilled with slight variations - enough surprise to maintain attention, enough regularity to maintain prediction. Too predictable = boring. Too unpredictable = chaos. The sweet spot creates the irresistible urge to move.

This predictive processing might be why all cultures create rhythm. It's cognitive calisthenics - training temporal prediction abilities essential for everything from walking to talking to thinking.
