## Core Insight
Music and language might be twin offspring of a single parent - a proto-communication system that split into semantic and aesthetic channels.

## Content
Infants understand musical communication before linguistic. Motherese (baby talk) is musical - exaggerated pitch contours, rhythmic patterns, repetition. This isn't cultural; it's universal. We sing meaning before we speak it.

Brain regions for music and language overlap but aren't identical. Damage to Broca's area can eliminate speech while preserving singing. Some stutterers can sing fluently. This suggests parallel systems with common origins.

Prosody - the music of speech - carries emotional meaning. Tone languages like Mandarin blur the boundary entirely. Perhaps language extracted the semantic channel from music, leaving music to develop the emotional, aesthetic, and transcendent channels.
