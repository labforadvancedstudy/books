## Core Insight
Rhythms naturally synchronize - from pendulum clocks to fireflies to human hearts, the universe tends toward shared beats.

## Content
When two rhythmic processes interact, they tend to synchronize. Huygens discovered this when pendulum clocks on the same wall aligned their swings. Fireflies flash in unison. Women in close proximity synchronize menstrual cycles.

Music exploits this fundamental physical principle. A strong beat literally pulls our neural oscillations into alignment. We can't help but tap our feet - our motor cortex has been hijacked by entrainment. DJs use this to control dancefloors. Drummers use it to unite tribes.

Entrainment might be why music exists - it's a technology for synchronizing human biorhythms, creating group cohesion through shared temporal experience.
