# Anti-Cheat Evolution
## Core Insight
The history of anti-cheat is an arms race between detection and deception, each advance spurring counter-advancement in an endless cycle.

## Content
**Social Solutions** came first:
- Reputation systems (trust networks)
- Community policing (player reports)
- Honor codes (self-regulation)
- Public shaming (social consequences)

**Technical Solutions** escalated the war:
- Server-side validation (trust nothing)
- Anti-cheat software (kernel-level detection)
- Machine learning (behavioral analysis)
- Hardware authentication (trusted computing)

**Design Solutions** attack the root:
- Cheat-resistant mechanics (server authority)
- Reduced incentives (why cheat?)
- Asymmetric information (can't cheat what you don't know)
- Embracing creativity (make exploits features)

Each solution breeds new problems. Kernel anti-cheat raises privacy concerns. Machine learning has false positives. Design constraints limit gameplay. Social solutions create toxic witch hunts.

The perfect anti-cheat system would destroy the game it protects. Some chaos, some trust, some vulnerability is necessary for play. The goal isn't eliminating cheating but managing it at tolerable levels.
