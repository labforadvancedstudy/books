# Psychology of Cheaters
## Core Insight
The cheater's paradox: winning by cheating feels hollow, yet cheating continues. This suggests winning isn't the real goal - power and control are.

## Content
Why do people cheat? The surface reasons vary:
- **Winning obsession**: Victory at any cost
- **Shortcut seeking**: Avoiding effort
- **Revenge**: "They cheated first"
- **Exploration**: "What happens if..."
- **Boredom**: Making stale games interesting
- **Incompetence**: Can't win fairly

But deeper motivations lurk. Cheating is often about asserting control over systems and other players. It's about feeling clever, beating not just opponents but the game itself.

Cognitive dissonance kicks in immediately. Cheaters rationalize:
- "Everyone else does it"
- "It's not really cheating" 
- "The game is unfair anyway"
- "I deserve to win"

The tragedy? Cheating destroys what it seeks. The cheater can never know if they could have won legitimately. They've robbed themselves of genuine achievement while pursuing its hollow shadow.
