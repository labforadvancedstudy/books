# The Magic Circle
## Core Insight
Games create a sacred boundary where normal rules don't apply and new ones reign supreme.

## Content
Step into a game and you cross an invisible threshold. Suddenly, it's okay to "kill" your 
friend (in tag), to "steal" their property (in Monopoly), to lie (in poker). The magic 
circle protects these actions from real-world consequences.

Huizinga called it the "magic circle" - the boundary that separates game from life. Inside, 
we agree to pretend. A cardboard square becomes Park Place. A wooden piece becomes a king. 
We all see the illusion and choose to believe.

This circle is fragile. One player refusing to play by the rules doesn't just break their 
game - they break everyone's. The magic dissolves. The pieces become wood and plastic again.
