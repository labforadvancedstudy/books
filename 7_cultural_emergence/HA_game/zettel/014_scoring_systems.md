# Scoring Systems - How We Measure Victory

**Core Insight**: Scoring systems transform nebulous concepts like "winning" into concrete, comparable numbers, creating objective hierarchies from subjective experiences and allowing play to have persistent meaning.

Before scores, games ended in arguments. "I won!" "No, I won!" Scoring systems are humanity's technology for creating indisputable victors. The number doesn't lie. Points are democracy crystallized - everyone agrees beforehand what counts, then the counting determines truth.

Different scoring systems create different games from identical mechanics. Basketball counting by 2s and 3s creates a different sport than if every basket scored 1. Point values are game designers' tools for shaping behavior - players pursue whatever scores highest, so designers encode values into numbers.

Scores enable comparison across time and space. Your high score persists after you leave. Leaderboards create asynchronous competition. Numbers become monuments to past achievement. The three letters next to "1ST" on an arcade machine are immortality in 8 bits.

But scoring also corrupts. Players optimize for points rather than fun, grinding repetitive actions because numbers go up. The score becomes the purpose, not the play. Games must balance between making scores meaningful enough to motivate but not so dominant they devour joy.
