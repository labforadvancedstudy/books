# Taking Turns
## Core Insight
"Now you, now me" - the fundamental social contract that transforms chaos into game.

## Content
Watch any group of children with one toy. Chaos. Grabbing. Tears. Then an adult says the 
magic words: "Take turns." Suddenly, there's order. There's anticipation. There's a game.

Turn-taking is so fundamental we forget it's learned. It's the heartbeat of games - my move, 
your move, my move, your move. It creates rhythm, fairness, and most importantly, it creates 
*waiting*. And in that waiting, strategy is born.

From peek-a-boo to chess, from hopscotch to poker, the turn is the atomic unit of game time. 
It divides the continuous flow of life into discrete, manageable chunks where anything can happen.
