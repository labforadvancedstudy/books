# 024 Time in Games

**Level**: L8 - Temporal Philosophy
**Domain**: Philosophy of Time, Phenomenology

## Core Concept

Games create their own temporal dimensions. They manipulate, compress, expand, and fragment time in ways that reveal the malleable nature of temporal experience itself.

## Key Insights

### 1. Multiple Time Streams
Games layer different temporalities:
- **Real time**: Clock on the wall
- **Game time**: Turns, rounds, matches
- **Narrative time**: Story progression
- **Psychological time**: Felt experience

### 2. Time Dilation Effects
Games warp temporal perception:
- Intense moments stretch (bullet time)
- Engaged hours compress (flow state)
- Waiting feels eternal (loading screens)
- Victories replay forever (memory loops)

### 3. Save States and Time Travel
Games allow temporal impossibilities:
- Save scumming: branching timelines
- Respawning: death as minor setback
- New Game+: cyclical time with memory
- Speedruns: optimizing temporal paths

## The Philosophical Puzzle

Do games reveal time's true nature?
- Linear progression is game convention
- Simultaneity exists in multiplayer
- Past and future collapse in strategy
- Present moment expands in action

## Temporal Architectures

Different games structure time differently:
- **Turn-based**: Discrete temporal chunks
- **Real-time**: Continuous flow
- **Asynchronous**: Disconnected timelines
- **Persistent**: Time continues without players

## Connection to HA

Games might be humanity's tool for experimenting with time itselfâ€”testing alternatives to our linear prison.
