# Economics of Cheating
## Core Insight
Cheating has evolved from individual rule-breaking into a multi-million dollar shadow industry with developers, support staff, and subscription models.

## Content
The cheat industry mirrors legitimate software:
- **Development teams** creating sophisticated tools
- **Subscription services** with monthly fees
- **Customer support** helping cheaters cheat
- **Regular updates** to beat anti-cheat measures

Professional cheating services include:
- **Boosting**: Playing someone's account to higher ranks
- **Account selling**: Leveled/geared characters
- **Tournament fraud**: Prize money theft
- **Stream deception**: Fake skills for viewers

The costs ripple outward:
- Games lose players who quit in frustration
- Developers spend millions on anti-cheat
- Legitimate players lose trust
- Entire communities can collapse

The economics create perverse incentives. Cheat developers need games to remain popular but broken enough to sell cheats. Game developers need to stop cheating but not so harshly they kill their community. Players want fair games but some will pay for advantages.

It's an economy built on destroying what it depends on - parasitic but profitable.
