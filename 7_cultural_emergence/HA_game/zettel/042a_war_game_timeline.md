## Ancient Origins

### 3000 BCE: Senet (Egypt)
- Cosmic battle representation
- Military imagery in pieces
- Strategic movement patterns
- Victory = spiritual triumph

Death and rebirth on a board. The afterlife as battlefield.

### 600 BCE: Chaturanga (India)
- Literal army simulation
- Four divisions: infantry, cavalry, elephants, chariots
- King protection paramount
- Birth of chess lineage

The first true war game. Every piece a soldier, every move a maneuver.

### 500 BCE: Go/Weiqi (China)
- Territory control abstraction
- Surrounding = capturing
- Strategic depth from simple rules
- War without warriors

Pure strategy emerges. No knights or kings, only space and control.

### 400 CE: Hnefatafl (Norse)
- Asymmetric warfare
- King escape scenarios
- Outnumbered defense
- Viking raid simulation

The defenders always outnumbered. Historical reality becomes game mechanic.

## Modern Military Gaming

### Prussian Kriegsspiel (1812)
- First modern military simulation
- Dice for combat uncertainty
- Umpired scenarios
- Actual battle preparation

War games enter military academies. Play becomes training.

### 20th Century Evolution
- RAND Corporation strategic games
- Computer warfare simulation
- Nuclear war scenarios
- Wargaming goes digital

Cold War fought on boards before buttons.

### Contemporary Training
- VR combat preparation
- Drone operator simulators
- Strategic AI opponents
- Cyber warfare games

The battlefield virtualizes. Games train for wars not yet invented.

## The Pattern Repeats

Every culture invents war games. Every empire trains through play. The urge to simulate conflict appears universal - perhaps because those who didn't practice perished.
