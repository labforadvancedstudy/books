# Winning and Losing
## Core Insight
Games teach us life's hardest lesson: sometimes you lose, and that's okay.

## Content
The moment a toddler learns to play, they learn to lose. Watch their face crumple the first 
time they don't win. Watch them try again. This is humanity's training ground for resilience.

Winning feels good. Really good. Our brains flood with dopamine, we want to play again. But 
losing? Losing teaches. Losing says "try something different." Losing builds character in 
ways winning never could.

The genius of games is that losing doesn't really matter. You lost at checkers? So what? 
Play again. This safe space for failure might be games' greatest gift to humanity.
