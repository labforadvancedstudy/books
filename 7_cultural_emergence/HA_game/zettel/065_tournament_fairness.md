# Tournament Fairness
## Core Insight
Perfect tournament fairness is mathematically impossible - every system has biases, advantages, and arbitrary decisions that affect outcomes.

**The Seeding Problem**: How do you rank players before they play? Historical performance? Recent form? Regional strength? Expert opinion? Every method has flaws. High seeds get easier paths - a self-fulfilling prophecy. Low seeds face murderer's row.

**Mathematical Paradoxes**:
- Arrow's Impossibility Theorem applies: no perfect ranking system exists
- Condorcet paradox: A beats B, B beats C, C beats A
- Strength of schedule: beating weak opponents vs. losing to strong ones
- Tiebreaker cascades: head-to-head, then goal difference, then...coin flip?

**Structural Biases**:
- Bye advantages: rest vs. rust
- Home/away imbalances in multi-leg ties
- Time zone effects in global tournaments
- Weather/surface advantages

**The Fairness Illusion**: We design elaborate systems (Swiss pairings, ELO ratings, computer rankings) to create fairness. But randomness, form fluctuations, and matchup problems mean the "best" team often doesn't win.

Maybe that's the point. Perfect fairness would be perfectly boring. The unfairness creates the drama we crave.
