# Homo Ludens
## Core Insight
Huizinga's revolutionary thesis: We are not just thinking beings (sapiens) or making beings (faber) - we are playing beings (ludens). Play is older than culture itself.

## Content
"Play is older than culture." With this simple statement in 1938, Johan Huizinga overturned centuries of thinking about human nature. 

Animals play without being taught. Play exists before language, before tools. All culture emerges from play. Even sacred rituals began as play. We don't play because we're human - we're human because we play.

Huizinga identified six characteristics of play:
1. Free (not obligatory)
2. Separate (bounded in time/space)
3. Uncertain (outcomes not predetermined)
4. Unproductive (creates no wealth)
5. Governed by rules (special conventions)
6. Make-believe (awareness of different reality)

This isn't just theory. Watch children create elaborate worlds from nothing, or adults absorbed in games. In play, we touch our essential nature.
