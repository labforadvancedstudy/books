# Huizinga's Six Characteristics
## Core Insight
Play has formal characteristics that distinguish it from all other human activities. These six traits define the magic circle.

## Content
Johan Huizinga defined play through six essential characteristics:

**1. Free**: Play is voluntary. Forced play isn't play - it's work, punishment, or performance. The moment coercion enters, play dies.

**2. Separate**: Play happens in designated times and spaces. The playground, the game board, the sports field - these create boundaries where different rules apply.

**3. Uncertain**: If you know the outcome, it's not play. Even in skill-based games, uncertainty creates tension and engagement.

**4. Unproductive**: Play produces no goods or wealth. A chess game creates nothing tangible. This "uselessness" is essential - it proves play is its own reward.

**5. Governed by rules**: Play creates its own order. These temporary rules override normal life. In tag, touching means transformation. In poker, lying is strategy.

**6. Make-believe**: Players know they're playing. This consciousness of "different reality" separates play from delusion or confusion.

Together, these create the paradox: serious non-seriousness.
