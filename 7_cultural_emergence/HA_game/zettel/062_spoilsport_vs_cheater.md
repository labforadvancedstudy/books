# Spoilsport vs Cheater
## Core Insight
The cheater pretends to play while breaking rules; the spoilsport refuses to acknowledge the game exists. Paradoxically, cheaters preserve the game illusion while spoilsports destroy it entirely.

## Content
Huizinga identified this crucial distinction:

The **cheater** still acknowledges the game. They want to win within the game's framework, just by different rules. They maintain the fiction that they're playing fairly. Their deception requires the game to continue.

The **spoilsport** denies the game's reality. "This is stupid." "It's just a game." "Why do you care so much?" They break the magic circle not through rule violation but through refusing to enter it.

Communities hate spoilsports more than cheaters. The cheater can be caught, punished, reformed. The spoilsport attacks the very premise that makes playing possible. They commit the unforgivable sin: revealing that the emperor has no clothes.

This shows why cheating is so serious. It's not about rules - it's about maintaining collective belief. The cheater threatens the game's integrity. The spoilsport threatens its existence.

Both reveal the same truth: games exist only through shared agreement to pretend they matter.
