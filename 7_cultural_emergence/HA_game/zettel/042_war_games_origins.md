## The Domestication of Violence

War games represent humanity's profound achievement: transforming deadly conflict into intellectual competition. Every strategic board game echoes ancient battles, converting blood into wood and death into defeat.

## The Evolution Pattern

```
Actual Combat → Training Exercise → Noble Pastime → Common Entertainment
                        ↑
                Military Academy
                   Staple
```

From Prussian Kriegsspiel to Call of Duty, the pattern repeats: military necessity becomes civilian entertainment.

## Core Categories

1. **Direct Combat**: Chess, Stratego - armies clash
2. **Territory Control**: Go, Risk - space dominates
3. **Economic Warfare**: Monopoly, trade games - markets as battlefields
4. **Abstract Conflict**: Checkers, Othello - pure strategy

## Deep Insights

1. **War Games Reveal War's Structure**: Stripped of death, patterns emerge
2. **Conflict Is Human**: We must compete, better on boards than battlefields
3. **Abstraction Enables Empathy**: Enemy becomes opponent becomes friend
4. **Strategy Transcends Violence**: Intellectual combat satisfies
5. **Games Prevent Wars**: Maybe, through sublimation and understanding

## The Ultimate Question

Can we keep civilization itself - our ultimate war game - as just a game?
