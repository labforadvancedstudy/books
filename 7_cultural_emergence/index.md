- **Stone Age**: Expressing the sacred
- **Agricultural**: Codifying traditions  
- **Classical**: Exploring ideals
- **Industrial**: Documenting change
- **Digital**: Creating new realities
- **AI Age**: Consciousness exploring itself through machines

## Why Culture Matters
While technology extends our capabilities, culture expresses our essence:
- Art makes the invisible visible
- Music touches the ineffable
- Stories create shared meaning
- Games let us explore possibilities
- VR lets us inhabit alternatives
