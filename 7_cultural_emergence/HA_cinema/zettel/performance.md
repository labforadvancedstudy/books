# Performance

## Core Insight
Acting for camera versus acting for humans - the intimate art of performing for a mechanical eye.

Film performance is paradox:
- Act natural in unnatural conditions
- Be spontaneous in 20th take
- Project emotion to cold lens
- Perform in fragments assembled later
- Be "real" while hitting marks exactly

Stage acting projects outward. Film acting draws inward. The camera sees too much - every micro-expression, every false note. Film actors learn: less is more, except when more is exactly right.

The evolution:
- Silent film: pantomime without words
- Early talkies: theatrical delivery
- Method acting: "becoming" the character
- Technical acting: precise emotional control
- Motion capture: performing as data

Great film performances feel like non-performance. We forget we're watching acting. But it's the most artificial naturalness imaginable - behavior crafted for specific lenses at specific distances in specific light.

The camera loves certain faces mysteriously. "Camera presence" - that ineffable quality where someone becomes MORE themselves on screen. Not beauty necessarily, but photogenic truth.

Digital allows infinite takes, infinite adjustment. But magic still happens in the moment - the take where everything aligns and electricity passes through the lens into forever.
