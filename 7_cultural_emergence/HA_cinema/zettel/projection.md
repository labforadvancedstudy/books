# Projection

## Core Insight
The act of throwing light through images onto surfaces - transforming private visions into shared experiences.

Projection is cinema's delivery system, but it's also its metaphor. We project:
- Light through film
- Images onto screens
- Emotions onto characters
- Meanings onto stories
- Ourselves onto narratives

The projector booth was cinema's hidden heart - a modern cave where shadows on walls became more real than reality. The projectionist: part technician, part shaman, controlling the collective dream.

Early projection was dangerous. Nitrate film could explode. Carbon arc lamps could blind. The projection booth had to be fireproof, isolated. Fitting metaphor: dreams separated from reality by necessity.

Digital projection killed the romance. No more physical film threading through gates. No more changeover marks. No more projection booth mysteries. But gained: perfect copies, no degradation, infinite distribution.

Yet we still "project" - our hopes, fears, desires onto the screen. The technology changed but the psychology didn't. We still sit in the dark, watching light become life.
