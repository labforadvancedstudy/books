# Animation

## Core Insight
Cinema freed from photography - the art of creating life from nothing but time and imagination.

Animation is cinema's purest form. No actors, no locations, no physical reality required. Just images changing over time. Yet it creates the most vivid realities.

Animation reveals cinema's truth: ALL film is animation. Live action just uses photographs of actors as frames. Animation uses drawings, pixels, puppets, anything. Same principle: persistence of vision creating life.

The paradox of animation:
- Can show anything, often shows impossible
- Free from physics, creates own physics
- No natural constraints, must invent constraints
- Ultimate control yields need for chaos

Animation styles are worldviews:
- Disney: reality perfected
- Anime: emotion externalized
- Stop motion: texture and weight
- Abstract: pure movement and color
- CGI: reality replaced

Digital killed the boundary. Every blockbuster is partially animated. Motion capture makes actors into puppets. Deep fakes animate the dead. We're all animations now.

But animation's gift remains: showing inner life as outer reality. In animation, metaphor becomes literal. Hearts actually break. People actually fly. Dreams actually appear. The impossible becomes visible.
