# Montage

## Core Insight
The discovery that meaning lives not in shots but between them - cinema's unique grammar of juxtaposition.

Kuleshov showed it first: same face + different images = different emotions. The viewer creates meaning from collision. A + B = C, where C exists only in consciousness.

Montage is:
- Temporal (then/now/later)
- Spatial (here/there/everywhere)
- Emotional (calm/chaos/resolution)
- Conceptual (thesis/antithesis/synthesis)
- Rhythmic (long/short/long)

Eisenstein pushed further: montage as conflict, as dialectic, as thinking itself. Not smooth continuity but productive collision. The gap between shots is where viewers work, creating connections.

Hollywood hid montage in continuity editing - invisible cuts that maintain illusion. Soviet cinema celebrated it - visible cuts that create ideas. Both right: montage can hide or reveal itself.

Digital editing makes infinite montage possible. Cut anywhere, anytime, to anything. But discovered: too many choices paralyze. Montage needs resistance, needs reason, needs rhythm.

The deepest truth: consciousness itself works through montage. We don't experience continuously but in cuts, jumps, associations. Cinema's editing mimics mind's editing. That's why it feels natural despite being completely artificial.
