# Time Manipulation

## Core Insight
Cinema's superpower: making time plastic - speeding, slowing, reversing, fragmenting the unstoppable flow.

In life, time moves one direction at one speed. In cinema, time is clay:
- Slow motion: revealing hidden grace
- Fast motion: showing invisible patterns
- Freeze frame: stopping the unstoppable
- Reverse: undoing the irreversible
- Jump cuts: erasing duration
- Cross-cutting: simultaneous times

Each manipulation creates meaning:
- Slow motion violence = balletic beauty or horrible detail
- Fast motion crowds = ant-like meaninglessness
- Freeze on face = moment of realization
- Reverse explosion = impossible resurrection

But deeper: cinema revealed time isn't uniform. Emotional time, memory time, dream time all move differently than clock time. Cinema makes subjective time visible.

Tarkovsky understood: time is cinema's essential material. Not story, not image - time itself. Sculpting in time. Each shot has its own time pressure, own duration needs.

Digital enables infinite time play. But discovered: just because you can doesn't mean you should. Time manipulation without purpose is just effect. With purpose, it's poetry - showing how consciousness really experiences duration.
