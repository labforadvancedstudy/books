# Virtual Reality Cinema

## Core Insight
The promise and problem of frameless cinema - when the screen disappears, what is film?

VR breaks cinema's fundamental constraint: the frame. No edges, no fixed perspective, no forced attention. You can look anywhere. You might miss everything.

VR cinema challenges:
- Where to guide attention without frame?
- How to edit without disorientation?
- How to pace when viewers control viewing?
- How to maintain presence across cuts?
- How to tell story in 360 degrees?

New techniques emerging:
- Spatial audio guiding attention
- Light/movement attracting eyes
- Impossible spaces that make sense
- Embodied transitions (you move, scene changes)
- Environmental narrative (story everywhere)

But deeper question: is VR cinema or something else? When viewer has agency, when world responds, when presence replaces projection - have we left cinema behind?

Maybe VR isn't cinema's evolution but offspring. Related but distinct. Cinema taught VR visual language, emotional engagement, world building. But VR must find own grammar for frameless, embodied, responsive storytelling.

The holy grail: narrative presence. Not watching story but being IN story while it remains crafted experience. The paradox of authored freedom. Cinema's dream since beginning.
