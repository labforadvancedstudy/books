## Core Insight
The paradox of individual vision in collaborative medium - cinema's struggle between art and industry.

Film is made by hundreds, sometimes thousands. Yet we speak of "a Hitchcock film," "a Kubrick film." The auteur theory: despite collaboration, singular vision can dominate.

Auteur signs:
- Visual style (every frame recognizable)
- Thematic obsessions (same questions explored)
- Narrative patterns (similar story shapes)
- Performance styles (actors become extensions)
- Sound design (distinctive aural world)

But auteurism is partly myth. Films are:
- Producer influenced
- Star shaped
- Editor created
- Cinematographer painted
- Composer felt

Yet some directors DO impose total vision. Kubrick controlling every detail. Malick finding film in editing. Lynch creating worlds only he understands. Their collaborators become instruments.

Digital democratized auteurism. Cheaper tools mean more control. One person CAN make entire film. But discovered: collaboration often creates richer work than isolation.

Modern auteurism includes showrunners, game designers, VR creators. Anyone who shapes extended vision across media. The auteur evolves but the hunger for singular vision remains - the desire to see world through another's eyes completely.
