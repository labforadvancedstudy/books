# Space Construction

## Core Insight
Cinema creates impossible spaces - coherent worlds built from fragments that never existed together.

The Kuleshov effect works for space too. Man looks + building exterior + room interior = man in building. But the shots were filmed months apart, miles away. The space exists only in viewer's mind.

Cinema constructs space through:
- Establishing shots (the whole)
- Coverage (the parts)
- Eyeline matches (the connections)
- Sound bridges (the continuity)
- Movement (the pathways)

But cinema space follows dream logic:
- Rooms bigger inside than outside
- Distances that expand/contract by need
- Doors that open anywhere
- Geography that serves story

The 180-degree rule, matching action, consistent screen direction - all tricks to maintain spatial coherence. Break them intentionally = disorientation. Break them accidentally = confusion.

Digital space goes further: impossible architectures, non-Euclidean geometries, spaces that transform. But discovered: viewers need spatial anchor. Total chaos isn't freedom - it's vertigo.

The magic: we build these spaces automatically. Show us fragments, we create wholes. Cinema doesn't depict space - it activates our space-construction machinery. We're co-architects of every film world.
