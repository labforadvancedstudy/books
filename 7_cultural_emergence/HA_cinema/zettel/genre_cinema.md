# Genre Cinema

## Core Insight
Cinema's contract system - shared expectations that enable infinite variation within recognized forms.

Film genres aren't just categories. They're promise structures:
- Horror: you will feel fear
- Comedy: you will laugh
- Action: you will feel excitement
- Romance: you will feel love
- Drama: you will feel

Each genre developed unique cinematic languages:
- Horror: darkness, sudden reveals, subjective camera
- Western: wide shots, landscape as character, moral clarity
- Film noir: shadows, urban maze, doomed protagonist
- Musical: reality breaks into song, emotion as movement
- Sci-fi: effects as speculation, future as mirror

Genre enables efficiency. Audiences know what they're buying. Filmmakers can shorthand. Everyone understands the rules. Then genius breaks them productively.

But genres evolve, merge, die, resurrect:
- Western → Space Western
- Horror + Comedy = Horror Comedy
- Superhero ate everything

Digital effects liberated genre from physical constraints. Any world possible. But discovered: genre isn't about possibility but satisfaction. Meeting expectation in unexpected ways.

Modern problem: genre exhaustion. Audiences seen every variation. Solution: genre deconstruction, meta-commentary, or perfect execution of familiar forms. The game continues at higher level.
