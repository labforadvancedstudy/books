# Sound

## Core Insight
The invisible half of cinema - what we hear shapes what we see more than we realize.

Cinema was never truly silent. Even "silent" films had music, effects, sometimes narration. But synchronized sound changed everything. Suddenly, the image had a voice.

Sound in cinema is:
- Diegetic (exists in the story world)
- Non-diegetic (exists only for audience)
- Meta-diegetic (exists in character's mind)

But these categories blur. Is the ominous music "real" or soundtrack? Does it matter if it shapes our fear?

Sound does what image cannot:
- Suggests off-screen space (the world beyond frame)
- Creates continuous reality (across cuts)
- Manipulates emotion directly (music bypasses cognition)
- Provides information efficiently (one line vs. visual exposition)

The power is in combination. Image + sound = more than sum. A door closing sounds different in comedy vs. horror. Same sound, different context, different meaning.

Digital sound enabled total control. Every footstep designed. Every breath placed. Silence itself becomes a choice. We build sonic worlds as detailed as visual ones.

But greatest power remains simple: the human voice saying human words. All technology serves this ancient need - to hear stories told.
