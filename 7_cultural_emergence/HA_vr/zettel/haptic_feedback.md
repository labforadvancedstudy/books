# Haptic Feedback

## Core Insight
Touch completes the illusion - when virtual objects push back, the mind accepts them as real.

Haptics bridges the last sensory gap. Vision and audio can be perfectly simulated, but without touch, virtual objects remain ghosts. Add vibration when you "contact" something, resistance when you "grip," and suddenly pixels have substance.

The evolution: rumble → precise vibration → ultrasound mid-air touch → full-body suits. Each step adds resolution to virtual texture. We're teaching computers to speak the language of pressure, temperature, texture - the vocabulary of physical reality.
