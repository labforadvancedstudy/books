# Neural Interface

## Core Insight
The final convergence - when experience bypasses sensation entirely and reality streams directly into consciousness.

Neural interfaces represent VR's logical endpoint: eliminate the middleman of sensory organs. Why simulate photons hitting retinas when you can write visual experience directly to visual cortex? Why vibrate ear drums when you can inject sound into auditory processing?

But this isn't just efficiency - it's ontological revolution. If experiences can be directly written to consciousness, what distinguishes "real" from "artificial" experience? Neural VR wouldn't create virtual reality. It would reveal that all reality is virtual - patterns in neural firing we agree to call "real."
