# Virtual Production

## Core Insight
When filmmaking enters the Matrix - directors shape digital worlds in real-time while actors perform within them.

Virtual production inverts cinema's workflow. Instead of filming first, adding effects later, filmmakers work inside real-time rendered environments. LED walls display dynamic backgrounds. Actors see their digital surroundings. Directors adjust virtual suns like physical lights.

This fusion births new creative grammar. Camera movements impossible in reality. Locations that transform between takes. The boundary between pre-production, production, and post dissolves. Virtual production reveals all filmmaking was always world-building - now it's just literal.
