# Inside-Out Tracking

## Core Insight
The headset becomes aware of its place in the world - computer vision turning devices into spatial sensors.

Inside-out tracking inverted VR's architecture. Instead of external sensors watching headsets, headsets watch the world. Cameras on the device see environment, algorithms deduce position. No lighthouses, no setup, no bounds - just put on headset and exist in space.

This shift democratized VR. Complexity moved from user's room to manufacturer's lab. But deeper: it gave VR devices spatial intelligence. They don't just display worlds - they understand their position within THE world. Devices gaining environmental awareness presages ambient computing future.
