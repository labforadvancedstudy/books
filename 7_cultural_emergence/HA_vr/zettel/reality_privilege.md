# Reality Privilege

## Core Insight
The unexamined assumption that physical reality is inherently more valuable than virtual experience - a bias that VR forces us to confront.

"It's just virtual" dismisses digital experiences as less real, less meaningful. But for someone disabled finding freedom in VR, someone isolated finding community, someone exploring impossible worlds - which reality matters more? Reality privilege assumes physical = authentic, virtual = fake.

VR exposes this prejudice. When virtual experiences create real emotions, real relationships, real growth - the distinction crumbles. A concert in VR with friends feels more "real" than watching TV alone in physical space. Reality privilege is the new frontier of discrimination.
