# Field of View (FOV)

## Core Insight
The window size of virtual reality - too narrow and you're looking through binoculars, too wide requires inhuman optics.

Human vision spans roughly 220 degrees horizontally, 130 vertically. Most VR headsets manage 90-120 degrees. This mismatch creates the "scuba mask effect" - virtual worlds viewed through restrictive portholes. You turn your head more, lose peripheral awareness, feel constrained.

FOV limits reveal engineering's fight with physics. Wider views need larger displays, more complex optics, heavier headsets. Every degree costs weight, complexity, money. The quest for human-matching FOV drives VR hardware evolution. We're still looking through windows, dreaming of doors.
