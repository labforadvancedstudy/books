# Stereoscopy

## Core Insight
Two eyes, two images, one world - the fundamental trick that transforms flat displays into windows of depth.

Stereoscopy exploits binocular vision. Show each eye a slightly different image, and the brain fuses them into depth. This isn't simulation of 3D - it's hijacking the visual system's own depth detection mechanism.

The magic: 2 + 2 = 3D. Two flat images create a third dimension that exists nowhere but in consciousness. VR's most basic illusion reveals how all perception is construction.
