# Metaverse

## Core Insight
The persistent, shared, virtual layer of reality where digital experiences accumulate meaning through continuity and community.

"Metaverse" describes not a technology but a condition - when virtual spaces become persistent places, when digital actions have lasting consequences, when online identities carry social weight. It's less destination than emergence: the internet gaining spatial dimension.

The dream: seamless travel between virtual worlds, portable identity, universal economy, shared presence. The reality: walled gardens, incompatible platforms, corporate fiefdoms. The metaverse exists in the tension between open protocol and private profit, between utopian vision and dystopian control.
