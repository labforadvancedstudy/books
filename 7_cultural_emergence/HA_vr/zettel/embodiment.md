# Embodiment

## Core Insight
The profound shift from having a body to being a body in virtual space - where avatar becomes self.

Embodiment transcends visual representation. It's the integration of virtual body into your motor-sensory loop. Move your hand, see "your" virtual hand move. Soon, prediction systems update. Proprioception adapts. The virtual body becomes incorporated into body schema.

This creates VR's most disturbing magic: body transfer illusion. With proper sensory correlation, you'll accept tentacles as arms, giants' bodies as your own. Embodiment reveals the shocking plasticity of self-perception. We are not as fixed as we believe.
