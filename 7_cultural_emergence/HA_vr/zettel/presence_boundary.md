# Presence Boundary

## Core Insight
The gossamer membrane between believing and knowing - where immersion is so complete that disbelief doesn't just suspend but dissolves.

The presence boundary is VR's event horizon. Cross it, and virtual becomes primary reality. Your body believes. Your reflexes respond. Your emotions engage fully. You know it's virtual, but knowing becomes irrelevant. The experience subsumes the analysis.

This boundary shifts. Fatigue lowers it. Familiarity raises it. Children cross easily. Skeptics resist. But everyone has a threshold where technology disappears and only experience remains. Finding and maintaining this boundary is VR design's highest art.
