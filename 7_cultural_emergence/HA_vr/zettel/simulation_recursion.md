# Simulation Recursion

## Core Insight
Creating virtual realities forces the question - if we can simulate consciousness-supporting realities, how do we know we're not simulated?

VR is humanity's first successful reality simulation. As fidelity improves, as AI inhabits virtual worlds, as virtual beings gain complexity - we approach a threshold. When our simulations can support conscious entities, probability suggests we're likely simulations ourselves.

The recursion: beings in VR creating VR creating VR... infinite nested realities. Each level convinced of its primacy. VR doesn't just entertain - it demonstrates reality's possible artificiality. Every headset is an argument for the simulation hypothesis.
