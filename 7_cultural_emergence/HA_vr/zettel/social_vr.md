# Social VR

## Core Insight
When presence meets presence - the unprecedented experience of sharing impossible spaces with real people in unreal bodies.

Social VR isn't just multiplayer with headsets. It's collective hallucination made real. Two people in different continents can feel present in the same non-existent room. Hand gestures, head nods, proxemics - the subtle language of physical presence translates into virtual space.

But something new emerges: identity fluidity. Meet as dragons, robots, abstract shapes. Gender, race, species become costumes. Social VR reveals how much "presence" depends on behavior, not appearance. The mind fills gaps, reads humanity into gestures, finds souls in avatars.
