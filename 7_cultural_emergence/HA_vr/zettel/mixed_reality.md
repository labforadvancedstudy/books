# Mixed Reality

## Core Insight
The dissolution of boundaries - where virtual and physical interweave so thoroughly that distinguishing them becomes meaningless.

Mixed Reality (MR) transcends both VR and AR. Not replacing reality (VR) or overlaying it (AR), but creating hybrid spaces where digital and physical objects share equal ontological status. Virtual ball bounces off real table. Real hand casts shadow on virtual object. The categories collapse.

MR reveals reality's malleable nature. If virtual objects can interact with physical ones, affect them, be affected by them - what defines "real"? MR is philosophy made visible: reality is not binary but spectrum, not fixed but fluid.
