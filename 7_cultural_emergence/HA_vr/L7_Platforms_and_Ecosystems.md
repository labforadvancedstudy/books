*The systems, standards, and societies building our virtual future*

> "The platform war is over. The ecosystem war has just begun." - Tim Sweeney

## The Platform Paradigm

VR isn't just hardware. It's entire ecosystems - platforms that support creation, distribution, and connection. Like early personal computers, the battle isn't for best specs. It's for the thriving ecosystem.

Each platform is a bet on VR's future:
- Closed garden or open field?
- Mobile-first or PC-powered?
- Social-centric or productivity-focused?
- Gaming roots or general computing?

The answers shape virtual reality's evolution.

- Build user base first
- Long-term thinking

Works if ecosystem thrives. Expensive if not.

### Revenue Models

**Traditional**: 30% store cut
**Subscription**: Recurring platform access
**Advertising**: Coming but controversial
**Enterprise**: B2B licensing
**Hardware**: Profit from devices

Most platforms trying multiple models.

### Developer Economics

**The Reality**:
- Few developers profitable
- Platform holder takes 30%
- Marketing costs high
- Piracy concerns
- Small user base (relatively)

Passion drives development more than profit currently.

### The Chicken-Egg Problem

Platforms need content to attract users.
Developers need users to justify development.
Someone must move first.

Meta's solution: Fund developers directly.
Valve's solution: Let community create.
Sony's solution: First-party showcase.
