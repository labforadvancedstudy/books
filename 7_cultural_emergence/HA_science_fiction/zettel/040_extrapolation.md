Extrapolation: SF's scientific method
Take current trend, extend to breaking point
Not prediction but exploration
If this goes on... then what?

Classic extrapolations:
- Population growth → overpopulation dystopias
- Automation → post-scarcity or mass unemployment
- Social media → Black Mirror nightmares
- Climate change → drowned worlds
Each pushing trends past comfort zones

The danger: straight-line thinking
Reality moves in curves, breaks, reversals
Yesterday's extrapolation becomes today's anachronism
Flying cars but missing smartphones

Good extrapolation includes second-order effects:
not just "what happens" but "how people adapt"
The human response changing the equation
Feedback loops and unintended consequences
