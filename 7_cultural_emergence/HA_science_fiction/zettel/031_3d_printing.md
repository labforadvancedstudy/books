"Tea, Earl Grey, hot" - Picard's replicator request
The ultimate manufacturing dream: atoms to order
Star Trek imagined molecular assembly
Reality gave us layer-by-layer plastic extrusion

The gap between vision and implementation:
- replicators work at molecular level instantly
- 3D printers work in millimeters over hours
- still revolutionary for prototyping and customization
- democratizing manufacturing one layer at a time

Medical applications approaching SF dreams:
printing organs, bones, tissues
The body as substrate for additive manufacturing
Closer to Trek's vision than desktop printers

The real transformation: moving from mass production
to mass customization - everyone a manufacturer
The means of production literally on your desktop
