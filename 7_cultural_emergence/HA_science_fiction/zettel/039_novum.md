Category: sf_theory
Type: core_concept
Definition: the_new_thing_that_changes_everything

The novum: SF's essential difference engine
That one change that cascades through reality
Not just a gadget but a reality-altering premise
The butterfly effect as narrative principle

Examples of great nova:
- FTL travel (space operas)
- Time travel (temporal paradoxes)  
- AI consciousness (what is human?)
- Immortality (social structures collapse)
Each novum asking "what if?" seriously

The discipline: one novum per story
Multiple nova dilute impact
Follow single change to logical extremes
Rigor in speculation

Bad SF: novum as wallpaper
Good SF: novum as thought experiment
Great SF: novum revealing human nature
The new thing showing what never changes
