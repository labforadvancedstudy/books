# 045_sf_reality_collapse

Science fiction writers used to imagine futures decades or centuries away.
Now their "far future" scenarios become reality before the books go out of print.
The lag between imagination and implementation approaches zero.

William Gibson famously said, "The future is already here—it's just not evenly distributed."
But now the future arrives so fast it's not even sequentially distributed.
We're living multiple sci-fi timelines simultaneously.

Yesterday's dystopian fiction is today's startup pitch deck.
Black Mirror episodes become product announcements within months.
The writers scramble to imagine futures that outpace implementation.

The uncanny valley isn't just about robots anymore—it's about reality itself.
When deepfakes perfect human mimicry, when AI passes every Turing test,
when virtual worlds become indistinguishable from real ones—what then?

Science fiction served as humanity's early warning system.
But what happens when the warnings arrive after the technology?
We're debugging reality without having read the manual.

The collapse accelerates: SF writers now consult for tech companies.
Their job isn't imagining impossible futures but preventing inevitable ones.
Fiction has become a branch of risk management.

The final collapse: when writing science fiction becomes impossible
because reality outpaces imagination faster than words can be typed.
We're living in everyone's science fiction simultaneously—and no one's.
