# Mars Colonization

## Core Insight
The backup drive for human consciousness. Mars isn't about exploration - it's about insurance. One asteroid, one war, one pandemic away from extinction. Mars makes us a two-planet species.

## Body
Science fiction sold Mars as frontier, but Musk sells it as necessity. The romance remains - red horizon, two moons dancing, dust storms like ancient gods. But the rationale shifted from manifest destiny to existential hedge. We go to Mars not because it's there, but because Earth might not always be.

Robinson's Mars trilogy got the politics right: competing visions for a new world. Terraform or preserve? Corporate or communal? Earth's child or independent civilization? Every Earth conflict replays on virgin regolith, but this time we know the stakes.

The technical challenges read like hard SF: perchlorates in soil, radiation without magnetosphere, gravity at 38%. Pregnancy in low-g? Psychology of 50-million-mile isolation? Solutions exist - underground cities, magnetic shields, genetic adaptation. Engineering problems have engineering solutions.

But Mars's real gift: forcing humanity to see itself as one species. No nations on Mars, just humans versus entropy. The overview effect from orbit becomes the red planet perspective - Earth as pale blue dot, precious and fragile. Mars colonists won't be Martians. They'll be Earth's children who finally grew up.

SpaceX made it real. Not someday, but this decade. Starship stacking in Texas while SF writers scramble to keep up. The future has a launch window, and it's measured in years, not centuries.
