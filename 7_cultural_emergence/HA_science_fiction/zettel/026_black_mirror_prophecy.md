Charlie Brooker's "Black Mirror" doesn't predict the future - it screenshots the present with brightness turned up.
Each episode's horror: technology we have plus human nature we know equals dystopia tomorrow.

"The Entire History of You": memory implants. Reality: lifelogging, constant recording.
"Nosedive": social credit scores. Reality: China's system, Instagram's psychological damage.
"USS Callister": consciousness trapped in games. Reality: AI in sandboxes, digital slavery.
"Be Right Back": digital resurrection. Reality: chatbots trained on deceased's messages.

Brooker's formula: take existing tech, add one iteration, explore hell scenario.
Not sci-fi but psychological horror wearing technology's skin.
"San Junipero" proved he could do utopia - chose not to repeat.
Each episode a warning label tech industry ignores while building it anyway.

Predictions becoming reality:
- Robot dogs ("Metalhead") → Boston Dynamics
- Blocking people IRL ("White Christmas") → AR filters
- Killer drones ("Hated in the Nation") → Autonomous weapons
- Memory manipulation ("Crocodile") → Deep fakes

"Black Mirror" as verb: when reality mirrors the show's darkness.
Netflix's interactive "Bandersnatch" - making viewers complicit in dystopia.
The show's real horror: we watch warnings while building the nightmares.
Mirror, mirror on the wall - who's the most surveilled of all?
