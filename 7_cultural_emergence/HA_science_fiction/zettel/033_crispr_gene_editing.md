From: gattaca_to_reality

Gattaca's genetically stratified society arrived early
CRISPR-Cas9 making gene editing cheap and accessible
The future where DNA determines destiny
Now available in labs worldwide for $75

SF warned of designer babies and genetic castes
Reality delivered: Chinese twins edited for HIV resistance
The ethical boundaries crossed before consensus formed
Pandora's box opened with a mail-order kit

The surprise: how easy it became
Bacteria's immune system repurposed as genetic scissors
Evolution's tool becoming our tool
Playing god with undergraduate lab equipment

Biohackers injecting themselves in garages
The democratization of genetic modification
SF imagined corporate/government control
Reality: DIY CRISPR kits on Amazon
