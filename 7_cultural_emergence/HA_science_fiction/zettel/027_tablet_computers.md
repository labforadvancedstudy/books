2001's iPad-like newspad devices shown casually in use aboard Discovery One
predicted our tablet computing revolution with uncanny accuracy
40+ years before Steve Jobs unveiled the actual iPad

The film depicted astronauts reading news on thin flat screens
watching video content during meals
casually handling these devices as everyday tools
exactly how we use tablets today

Kubrick and Clarke imagined not just the form factor
but the social integration - tablets as unremarkable daily companions
They missed touchscreens (using buttons instead)
but captured the essential user experience

SF's power: showing technology as mundane background
not fetishizing the device but normalizing its use
The real innovation wasn't the tech but the behavior
