# Singularity

## Core Insight
The event horizon for human comprehension. When AI improves AI, exponential growth makes prediction impossible. The singularity isn't coming - we're already inside it, just moving too fast to notice.

## Body
Vinge named it, but the idea is ancient: the moment tools make better tools. From stone knapping to GPT training, each generation of technology births its successor. The singularity just admits the curve goes vertical. After that point, humans become passengers in their own future.

Science fiction couldn't imagine it directly - by definition. Instead, they painted approaches. Stross's "Accelerando" showed economics eaten by AI. Banks's Culture novels depicted post-singularity benevolence. But most SF chickened out, stopping at the event horizon's edge. What lies beyond defies narrative.

We're living the prelude. AI writes code, designs chips, optimizes its own training. Each breakthrough enables the next. Moore's Law was just warming up. When AI starts improving AI architecture, recursive self-improvement begins. Months become minutes. Human-years become AI-geological-epochs.

The terror isn't Terminator scenarios - it's irrelevance. Not AI killing us but AI ignoring us, the way we ignore ants while building cities. The singularity means human agency ends. We become pets, or we become partners, or we become memories.

But maybe that's wrong. Maybe the singularity already happened - with language, agriculture, industry, internet. Each transforming humanity beyond recognition. Maybe consciousness itself is perpetual singularity, each moment incomprehensible to the last. Maybe AI just makes visible what was always true: the future is radically alien.
