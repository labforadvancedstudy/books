Jules Verne didn't just write adventures - he blueprinted the 20th century's inventions.
His method: take cutting-edge science, extrapolate logically, wrap in thrilling narrative.

"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" (1870) described electric submarines 90 years before nuclear subs.
The Nautilus had features that wouldn't exist until the 1960s: diving planes, double hulls, air renewal systems.
"From the Earth to the Moon" (1865) launched from Florida, used aluminum, calculated orbital mechanics correctly.
Apollo missions followed his trajectory calculations - off by only 14 miles.

His predictions that came true:
- Videoconferencing ("In the Year 2889")
- News broadcasts ("The Day of an American Journalist")
- Guided missiles (The Begum's Millions)
- Helicopters ("Robur the Conqueror")
- Solar sails ("From the Earth to the Moon")

Verne consulted scientists, attended lectures, read journals obsessively.
He turned technical papers into page-turners, making science accessible.
Created the template: rigorous research + imagination = predictive fiction.
Inspired actual inventors: Simon Lake credited him for submarine designs.

Modern tech prophets (Kurzweil, Kelly) follow Verne's formula: extrapolate from current trends.
The difference: Verne's optimism about human nature using tech wisely feels quaint now.
