Spielberg's "Minority Report" (2002) hired MIT scientists to design plausible 2054 interfaces.
John Underkoffler's gesture UI became reality within a decade - he founded Oblong Industries to build it.

The prescient predictions:
- Gesture control without touching (Kinect, Leap Motion)
- Personalized advertising scanning retinas (facial recognition ads)
- Predictive policing (PredPol, Chicago "heat list")
- Transparent displays (Samsung, LG prototypes)
- Self-driving cars (Tesla, Waymo)
- Scrubbing through time in video (every editing app now)

The film's UI philosophy: data as physical objects you manipulate in space.
Tom Cruise's hand-wave conducting became template for "future" interfaces.
Glove controllers seemed exotic then - now we have Quest hand tracking.
Multi-touch preceded iPhone but film popularized expectation.

What it got wrong: we went smaller (phones) not bigger (wall displays).
Privacy died differently - we gave it away, weren't forced.
Precogs replaced by algorithms - less dramatic, more pervasive.
Pre-crime exists: YouTube recommends radicalization, Instagram predicts self-harm.

Modern designers still reference those interfaces as aspirational.
Every tech conference has someone waving at screens, citing Minority Report.
Film's real prediction: surveillance capitalism dressed as convenience.
We got the interfaces and the dystopia - package deal.
