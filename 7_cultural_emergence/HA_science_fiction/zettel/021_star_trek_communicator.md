Star Trek's communicator (1966) didn't predict flip phones - it designed them into existence.
Motorola engineer Martin Cooper cited Kirk's communicator as direct inspiration for first cell phone.

The genius wasn't the technology but the interaction design:
- Flip open = answer (no buttons needed)
- Speak naturally (no earpiece required)
- Chest tap to activate (gesture UI before touchscreens)
- Network finds you (cellular concept visualized)

Trek normalized technologies before they existed:
- Universal translator (Google Translate)
- PADD tablets (iPad)
- Voice interface ("Computer...")
- Tricorder (smartphone sensors)
- Replicator (3D printing moving toward molecular assembly)

The show's design philosophy: technology should be invisible, intuitive, human-centered.
No typing, minimal buttons, voice-first - predicting post-keyboard interfaces.
Diverse bridge crew normalized what tech industry still struggles with.
"Beam me up" entered language before we had GPS to beam anywhere.

Modern impact: every tech demo references Star Trek.
Microsoft HoloLens = holodeck. Apple Watch = communicator evolved.
Designers study Trek for UI patterns that feel inevitable.
The show's real prediction: technology should serve humanity's best impulses.

We got the communicators. Still working on the post-scarcity utopia part.
