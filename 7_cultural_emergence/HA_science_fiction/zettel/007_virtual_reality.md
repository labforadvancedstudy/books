# Virtual Reality

## Core Insight
Reality is just the most persistent illusion. VR doesn't create fake worlds - it reveals that all worlds are created. From cave paintings to Quest 3, humanity always lived in virtual realities.

## Body
Science fiction got the interface wrong but the impact right. No neural jacks needed - just convince the eyes and inner ear. Palmer Luckey duct-taped his way to the Metaverse. Valve made Half-Life real enough to duck. Beat Saber turned everyone into Jedi. The future arrived at 90Hz.

But VR's real revelation: reality is negotiable. Your brain already constructs reality from electrical signals. VR just provides different signals. The question isn't "is it real?" but "is it persistent?" When VR worlds maintain state, develop history, harbor consciousness - what distinguishes them from base reality?

Ready Player One imagined escape. Snow Crash warned of linguistic viruses. The Matrix proposed we're already there. But the truth is mundane and profound: we'll slide into virtuality gradually. Remote work becomes virtual office. Social media becomes social space. Games become parallel lives.

The singularity might not be AI awakening but reality fragmenting. When everyone inhabits their own custom reality, consensus breaks down. Filter bubbles become filter worlds. Echo chambers become echo universes. VR doesn't replace reality - it multiplies it.

We're building Borges's garden of forking paths. Every headset a portal, every user a world-builder. The question isn't whether to enter virtual reality. It's whether we ever left.
