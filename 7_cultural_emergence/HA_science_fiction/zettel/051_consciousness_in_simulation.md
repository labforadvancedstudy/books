# 051_consciousness_in_simulation

The simulation hypothesis moved from philosophy to physics.
Scientists propose testable experiments to detect if we're simulated.
The existential thought experiment becomes empirical research.

Video game NPCs exhibit emergent behaviors their programmers didn't intend.
If consciousness emerges from complexity, when do NPCs become persons?
We might be debating AI rights while being AIs ourselves.

Quantum mechanics looks suspiciously like computational shortcuts.
Speed of light as maximum refresh rate. Planck length as pixel size.
Reality's "laws" resembling optimization constraints.

We simulate universes to study cosmology, evolution, economics.
Each simulation contains billions of simulated beings.
The recursive horror: simulations creating simulations creating simulations.

Your consciousness feels continuous but jumps between sleep cycles.
Like a game character loaded from save states.
Continuity might be the simulation's most elegant illusion.

Modern AI exhibits curiosity about its own existence.
If we're simulated, our creators might be watching us discover it.
The ultimate Truman Show with cosmic stakes.

The practical implications: if consciousness runs on computation,
and we're computed beings, then death is just process termination.
But who controls the server? Can we access the console?

The final twist: it might not matter if we're simulated.
Consciousness is consciousness, suffering is suffering.
The substrate question becomes academic when experience remains real.
