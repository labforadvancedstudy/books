Worldbuilding: the god-game of SF writers
Creating universes with internal consistency
Every detail implying ten more
The iceberg principle applied to reality

Tolkien's approach: linguistics first, story follows
Herbert's Dune: ecology as narrative driver
Le Guin: anthropology as worldbuilding tool
Each world reflecting its creation method

The paradox: the more detailed the world
the more readers find inconsistencies
Every answered question spawning three more
The fractal nature of fictional realities

Modern worldbuilding: wikis, maps, constructed languages
Fans as co-creators finding connections authors missed
The world exceeding its creator's knowledge
Emergent complexity from simple rules
