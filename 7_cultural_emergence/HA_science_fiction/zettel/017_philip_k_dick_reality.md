Philip K. Dick didn't predict the future - he diagnosed the present's psychosis and called it tomorrow.
His core question: How do we know what's real? Answer: We don't, and it's getting worse.

"Do Androids Dream?" became Blade Runner: empathy tests to prove humanity.
Today's CAPTCHAs are Voight-Kampff tests - proving we're human to machines.
"Total Recall" explored implanted memories before we understood memory's malleability.
"Minority Report" predicted pre-crime; now algorithms predict recidivism.

Dick's reality glitches now seem prophetic:
- Fake news ("The Penultimate Truth")
- Simulated worlds ("The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch")
- Corporate control of perception ("Ubik")
- AI indistinguishable from human ("The Electric Ant")
- Time as malleable construct ("Counter-Clock World")

His 2-3-74 experience: divine revelation or temporal lobe epilepsy? Both? Neither?
Wrote 8,000 pages trying to understand: "The Empire Never Ended."
Predicted our current crisis: consensus reality collapsed, everyone choosing their own.
Paranoid fiction became realist fiction - Dick was just early.

Facebook is UBIK. Twitter is Radio Free Albemuth. GPT is Palmer Eldritch.
We live in Philip K. Dick's nightmare and call it social media.
The android sheep are electric, but do they dream? Does it matter?
