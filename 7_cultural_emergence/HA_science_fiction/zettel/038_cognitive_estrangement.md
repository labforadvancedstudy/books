Cognitive estrangement: making the familiar strange
Suvin's definition of SF's essential move
Not escape FROM reality but escape TO reality
Seeing our world from outside

The technique: change one thing, follow implications
- genders reversed (Le Guin)
- time runs backward (Dick)
- consciousness transferable (Morgan)
Each change revealing hidden assumptions

Estrangement vs alienation:
productive discomfort not nihilistic despair
The goal: return to reality with new eyes
Tourism in alternate possibilities

SF as consciousness-altering technology
Each story a perception experiment
Breaking cognitive habits through narrative
Defamiliarization as enlightenment tool
