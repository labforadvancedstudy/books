# Level 1: Things That Don't Exist (Yet)

You're reading these words on a device that science fiction writers imagined before engineers knew how to build it. That's the first thing to understand about science fiction—it's not about predicting the future. It's about making the future happen.

## The Book in Your Hand

Remember the first time you saw an iPad? If you were old enough, you might have thought: "That's the thing from Star Trek." Or "That's like the newspad from 2001: A Space Odyssey." 

Science fiction writers in the 1960s described flat screens you could read like paper. They imagined you'd touch them to turn pages. They thought you'd carry libraries in your pocket. Crazy, right?

Except you're probably reading this on exactly that device right now.

## The Voice in the Room

"Hey Siri."
"OK Google."
"Alexa."

We talk to machines now. They talk back. Not perfectly, not with real understanding (yet), but they respond. They turn on lights, play music, answer questions.

In 1968, a movie called "2001: A Space Odyssey" showed a computer named HAL that could talk, listen, and think. HAL was supposed to be science fiction. HAL was supposed to be impossible. HAL was supposed to exist in the year 2001.

We're a bit late, but we're getting there.

## The Car That Drives Itself

When Knight Rider aired in 1982, KITT was pure fantasy—a car that could drive itself, talk to its driver, and make decisions. The show's creators thought they were being impossibly futuristic.

Today, Teslas navigate highways alone. Waymo taxis pick up passengers with no human driver. We're teaching cars to see, think, and react faster than human reflexes allow.

The fantasy became a startup. The startup became a product. The product became normal.

This is what science fiction does.

## The Call From Nowhere

Video calls were a staple of science fiction for decades. The Jetsons had them. Star Trek had them. Blade Runner had them. Everyone agreed: in the future, phone calls would have pictures.

Then 2020 happened. Suddenly, everyone on Earth knew how to use Zoom. What took decades to imagine took months to become essential. Science fiction didn't predict Zoom—it created the expectation that made Zoom inevitable.

## The Really Strange Part

Here's what should keep you up at night: we're running out of impossible things.

Tablet computers? Got them.
Voice assistants? Check.
Self-driving cars? Getting there.
Video calls? Old news.
Virtual reality? On your face.
Gene editing? In the lab.
Brain interfaces? In clinical trials.
Artificial intelligence? Reading this over your shoulder.

We used to read science fiction to imagine impossible futures. Now we read it to understand the present.

## What You're Actually Experiencing

When you use these technologies—when you ask Alexa a question or let your car park itself—you're not using "technology inspired by science fiction." You're using science fiction. The stories became blueprints. The blueprints became products. The products became your life.

This is Level 1: the direct experience of living inside science fiction. You don't have to imagine the future anymore. You're living in it. Every impossible thing in your pocket was once a writer's wild dream.

And the writers? They're still dreaming, but now their dreams have venture funding.

## Try This

Look around your room. Count the things that would be magic to someone from 1950. The glowing rectangle you're reading on. The voice that answers when you call. The games that create worlds. The watch that counts your heartbeat.

You live in science fiction. You just got used to it.

That's the most science fictional thing of all.
