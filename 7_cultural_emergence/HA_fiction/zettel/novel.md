# Novel

## Core Insight
The fiction form that discovered interiority: direct access to consciousness itself.

The novel did something impossible before writing: it let us inside someone else's head. Not just actions and speech, but thoughts, feelings, the actual texture of consciousness.

"Stream of consciousness" isn't a literary technique. It's what novels DO. They simulate consciousness in text form.

What novels enabled:
- Psychological depth (complex inner lives)
- Multiple perspectives (many consciousnesses)
- Time manipulation (flashback, foreshadowing)
- Detailed worlds (unlimited description)
- Private experience (reading alone)

The novel is fundamentally modern. It assumes:
- Individual psychology matters
- Inner life is rich/complex
- Private reading is valuable
- Long-form immersion is possible

No accident novels arose with:
- Printing press (mass distribution)
- Literacy (mass readers)
- Privacy (space to read)
- Individualism (self matters)

The novel's superpower: sustained hallucination. You live in a fictional world for days/weeks. Your consciousness merges with fictional consciousness.

Digital media threatens the novel. But consciousness still craves consciousness. As long as we wonder "what is it like to be someone else?", novels survive.
