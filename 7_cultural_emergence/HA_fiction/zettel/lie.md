# Lie

## Core Insight
The first fiction: when a human said something that wasn't true but could have been.

The moment someone said "I didn't eat the berries" with juice on their lips, fiction was born. Not as art, but as survival strategy. The ability to construct alternate realities in language.

Before lies, every utterance was an attempt at truth. After lies, language became a reality-construction tool. You could make things "true" by saying them convincingly enough.

This is the atomic moment: reality splitting from description. The birth of the subjunctive mood. What is vs what could be vs what I want you to believe.

Children discover this around age 3-4. The shocked delight when they realize they can say things that aren't so. That words can create false worlds. That others might believe them.

Every fiction since then - from campfire tales to Netflix series - is just an elaborate, socially acceptable lie we all agree to believe together.
