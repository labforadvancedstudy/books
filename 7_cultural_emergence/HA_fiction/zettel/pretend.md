# Pretend

## Core Insight
Fiction performed: when "this stick is a sword" becomes collectively real through play.

Watch children play. "I'm a dinosaur!" And suddenly, they ARE. Not lying, not confused - consciously operating in dual realities. The stick is simultaneously stick and sword. The cardboard box is spaceship and box.

This is fiction's primordial form: embodied alternate reality. Before we told stories, we enacted them. We became the fiction.

Pretending requires holding two truths simultaneously:
1. This is a stick (physical reality)
2. This is a sword (fictional reality)

And choosing to operate in the second while aware of the first. It's cognitive gymnastics that other animals can't do. A dog plays, but doesn't pretend the ball is a rabbit. Only humans can make nothing into something through collective agreement.

Theater, film, VR - all descendants of that first child who picked up a stick and said "En garde!"
