# Suspension of Disbelief

## Core Insight
The cognitive treaty: "I'll pretend this is real if you make it worth my while."

Coleridge named it: that willing suspension of disbelief that constitutes poetic faith. But it's older than poetry. It's the price of entry to fiction.

The mechanism:
1. Rational mind knows it's false
2. Imaginative mind agrees to forget
3. Emotional mind responds as if real
4. All three cooperate for the experience

It's not passive. It's active cognitive work. You consciously suppress the part that says "this is just words/images/actors."

What breaks suspension:
- Inconsistency (rules violated)
- Anachronism (wrong time)
- Bad dialogue (people don't talk like that)
- Plot holes (wait, that makes no sense)
- Author intrusion (agenda showing)

When it breaks, you're ejected from the fiction. Suddenly aware you're reading/watching. The magic dies.

But we WANT to believe. We'll forgive almost anything if the story rewards us. Dragons? Sure. FTL travel? Why not. True love? Obviously.

Modern challenge: we're too savvy. We know all the tropes. Solution: earn suspension through excellence. Make us forget we're suspending.
