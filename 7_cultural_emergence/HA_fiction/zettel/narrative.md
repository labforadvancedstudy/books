# Narrative

## Core Insight
The deep structure that turns mere sequence into meaningful story - the grammar of events.

Narrative is to story what grammar is to speech. It's the invisible rules that make random events feel inevitable in retrospect.

Key components:
- Causality: this because of that
- Temporality: order matters
- Agency: someone wants something
- Closure: tensions resolve (or meaningfully don't)

But here's the weird part: narrative isn't IN the events. It's imposed BY the mind. The same facts can yield opposite narratives. "He left because he loved her too much" vs "He left because he loved her too little."

Narrative is compression. Life has infinite detail; narrative selects what matters. Every inclusion is a theory about what causes what.

We're narrative addicts. Random dots on screen, we see faces. Random events in life, we see destiny. We can't NOT make patterns.

This is why "narrative warfare" works. Control the story, control reality. Facts matter less than the narrative frame they're placed in.
