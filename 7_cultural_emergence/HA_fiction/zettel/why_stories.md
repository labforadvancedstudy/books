# Why Stories

## Core Insight
The deepest mystery: why did the universe evolve entities that create fictional realities?

Every culture tells stories. No exceptions. Why?

Standard answers:
- Teaching tool (embed lessons)
- Social bonding (shared experience)
- Simulation (practice without risk)
- Entertainment (pleasurable)

But these explain how stories help, not why they exist.

Deeper possibility: Stories are how universe becomes self-aware.

Consider:
- Matter complexifies into life
- Life complexifies into consciousness
- Consciousness complexifies into story
- Story allows universe to model itself

We're the universe's way of telling itself what it's like to be.

Every story is a fragment of cosmic self-reflection:
- A romance = how connection feels
- A tragedy = how loss feels
- A comedy = how absurdity feels
- Science fiction = how possibility feels

Fiction isn't separate from reality. It's reality understanding itself through simulation and metaphor.

We don't tell stories. Stories tell us. We're the medium through which existence experiences all possible variations of itself.
