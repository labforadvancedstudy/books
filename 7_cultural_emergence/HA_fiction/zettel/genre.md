# Genre

## Core Insight
Fiction's taxonomy: shared expectations that enable infinite variation within recognized forms.

Genre is a contract between creator and audience. "This is a mystery" promises certain pleasures: puzzle, clues, solution. Break the contract at your peril.

Why do we need genres?
- Navigation (finding what we want)
- Expectation (knowing what we'll get)
- Innovation (variations on known)
- Community (shared language)

Major genre families:
- Mimetic (reflects reality)
- Fantastic (breaks reality)
- Emotional (love, fear, laughter)
- Structural (mystery, thriller)

But genres aren't fixed. They evolve, merge, spawn:
- Western + Space = Space Opera
- Horror + Comedy = Horror Comedy
- Romance + Mystery = Romantic Suspense

Genre is both liberation and prison:
- Liberation: established tools/tropes
- Prison: audience expectations

Great works transcend genre while honoring it. They deliver genre pleasures AND surprise.

Modern problem: genre exhaustion. We've seen every variation. Solution: genre mixing, deconstruction, meta-commentary. Or return to pure execution - doing the familiar perfectly.

Ultimately, genres are desires. We choose stories like meals, to satisfy specific hungers.
