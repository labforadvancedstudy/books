# Myth

## Core Insight
Stories so powerful they become explanatory frameworks for entire cultures.

Myths aren't just old stories. They're cognitive infrastructure. They answer the unanswerable: Why does the sun rise? Why do we die? Why is there evil?

Before science, myths were our theory of everything. They made the terrifying universe comprehensible by populating it with characters. Thunder isn't random - it's Zeus angry. Disease isn't meaningless - it's punishment or test.

The genius of myth: it works at every level:
- Literal: entertaining stories
- Psychological: maps of the psyche
- Social: shared values and warnings
- Cosmic: explanation of everything

Myths are viral ideas. They survive millennia because they encode deep truths in memorable forms. The hero's journey isn't just a story structure - it's how humans experience growth.

Modern myths: superheroes, space operas, conspiracy theories. We still need stories bigger than ourselves to locate ourselves in the cosmos.

Science killed the old myths but couldn't fill the meaning-void. So we create new ones, now knowing they're fiction. Marvel Universe. Star Wars. Still serving the same psychic need.
