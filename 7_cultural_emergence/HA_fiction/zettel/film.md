## Core Insight
Fiction at the speed of perception: stories told in the language of dreams.

Film is the most powerful fiction technology ever invented. It hijacks vision, hearing, and emotion simultaneously. It shows instead of tells.

Film's unique properties:
- Time control (slow, fast, cut, reverse)
- Space control (close-up to cosmic)
- Montage (meaning through juxtaposition)
- Sound design (emotional manipulation)
- Visual thinking (pre-linguistic)

We process film like lived experience, not like text. Your brain thinks you've BEEN places, SEEN things, KNOWN people. Film memories feel like real memories.

The grammar of film is the grammar of consciousness:
- Attention = camera focus
- Memory = flashback
- Imagination = dream sequence
- Emotion = music/color
- Thought = voiceover

Film colonized the global imagination. Everyone dreams in Hollywood grammar now. We think in cuts, close-ups, montages.

But film is totalitarian fiction. You see what director shows, when they show it. No imagination space. No reading between lines. Your perception is enslaved.

VR promises to free us. But film's constraint is its power. By controlling your gaze, it controls your mind.
