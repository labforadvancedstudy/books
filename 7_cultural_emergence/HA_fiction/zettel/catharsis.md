# Catharsis

## Core Insight
Emotional purgation through fictional suffering: feeling deeply to emerge cleansed.

Aristotle identified it in tragedy. Watch horrible things happen to fictional people, feel terror and pity, leave spiritually purified. Emotional homeopathy.

Why does watching suffering feel good?
- Safe distance (it's not real)
- Emotional exercise (feelings need expression)
- Meaning-making (suffering with purpose)
- Collective experience (shared emotion)

Catharsis isn't just release. It's transformation. You enter with emotional burden, experience fictional extremity, exit lighter.

Modern catharsis comes in many flavors:
- Horror (fear purged through scares)
- Romance (longing purged through fulfillment)
- Revenge fantasy (anger purged through justice)
- Tearjerker (sadness purged through crying)

The mechanism seems to be:
1. Identify with character
2. Experience their emotion intensely
3. Reach breaking point
4. Release and relief
5. Return to equilibrium

But catharsis can be addictive. Emotion junkies seeking bigger hits. Trauma porn. Misery Olympics. When does catharsis become emotional masturbation?

Still, we need it. Modern life suppresses emotion. Fiction provides safe spaces to feel fully.
