# Writing

## Core Insight
The technology that froze fiction in time, allowing stories to outlive their tellers.

Writing changed everything. Before: stories lived in memory, morphing with each telling. After: stories became fixed, authoritative, immortal.

The cognitive shift was massive:
- Oral stories are communal, flexible, performed
- Written stories are individual, fixed, consumed

Writing enabled:
- Complex plots (no memory limits)
- Interior monologue (thinking on the page)
- Precise language (revision possible)
- Authorship (individual creation)
- Canon (official versions)

But we lost:
- Communal ownership
- Adaptive retelling
- Performance energy
- Memory training

Writing made fiction into property. You could own a story. Copyright it. Sell it. This changed who tells stories and why.

The paradox: writing killed the oral tradition but enabled the novel. It froze stories but allowed them to travel further. It separated teller from tale but let tales outlive civilizations.

Every medium shift (writing → print → digital) transforms what stories can be.
