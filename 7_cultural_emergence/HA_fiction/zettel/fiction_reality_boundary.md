# Fiction-Reality Boundary

## Core Insight
The increasingly blurry line between what we call "fiction" and what we call "reality."

The boundary seemed clear: 
- Fiction = made up
- Reality = actually happened

But every examination dissolves it:
- Memory reconstructs (fiction-like)
- History selects and narrativizes (story-like)
- Identity is performed (character-like)
- Culture is shared fiction (myth-like)

We live in nested fictions:
- Personal story (who I am)
- Social fictions (money, law, status)
- Cultural narratives (progress, destiny)
- Species stories (humanity's purpose)

Meanwhile, fictions shape reality:
- 1984 prevents itself
- Star Trek inspires inventions
- Religious stories drive history
- Economic theories create markets

The digital age collapsed it further:
- Avatars feel like selves
- Virtual worlds have real economies
- AI characters seem conscious
- Deepfakes make fiction look real

Perhaps the boundary was always illusory. Reality is what we collectively agree is real. Fiction is reality we agree is fictional. But the agreement is all.

We're characters in stories we tell ourselves, unable to step outside narrative to see what's "really" real.
