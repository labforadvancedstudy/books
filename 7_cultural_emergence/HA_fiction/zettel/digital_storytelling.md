# Digital Storytelling

## Core Insight
Fiction exploded: when stories became interactive, networked, and infinite.

Digital didn't just change distribution. It changed what stories ARE.

New possibilities:
- Hypertext (choose your path)
- Procedural (stories from algorithms)
- Participatory (audience becomes authors)
- Transmedia (story across platforms)
- Infinite (no ending, always updating)

The page was prison. Digital freed fiction:
- Non-linear (any order)
- Multimedia (text + sound + image)
- Interactive (reader affects outcome)
- Social (experience together apart)
- Alive (stories that evolve)

But freedom brings chaos:
- Too many choices paralyze
- Infinite stories never satisfy
- Everyone author = no one audience
- Algorithm curation = filter bubbles

Digital fiction's forms:
- Games (story through play)
- Social media (distributed narrative)
- AI fiction (machine dreams)
- AR stories (fiction overlays reality)

We're still learning digital grammar. Like early film imitating theater, digital fiction imitates books. The native forms haven't emerged yet.

When they do, they might be unrecognizable as "stories" to us. Just as novels would bewilder Homer.
