# Four Noble Truths

## Core Insight
Buddhism's entire framework is a doctor's diagnosis: symptom, cause, prognosis, treatment.

## The Medical Model

First Truth: "Doctor, it hurts." (Dukkha exists)
Second Truth: "It hurts because you're grasping hot coal." (Craving causes suffering)
Third Truth: "Let go and the pain stops." (Cessation is possible)
Fourth Truth: "Here's how to let go." (The path)

Buddha wasn't being philosophical - he was being medical. Like a doctor who doesn't debate the metaphysics of disease but says: "You're sick. Here's why. You can get better. Take this medicine."

The genius: no faith required. Just observation. Watch your own mind for five minutes. See the grasping? See how it hurts? See moments when you let go? See the relief? That's the whole teaching.

Not "life is suffering" (mistranslation). More like: "There's this uncomfortable squeeze in experience, it comes from holding too tight, you can relax, here's how."
