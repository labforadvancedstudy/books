# Karma Mechanism

## Core Insight
Karma isn't cosmic justice - it's just causation applied to intentional actions, like tracks worn into mind through repetition.

## The Groove System

Think of mind as soft clay. Each intentional action presses a groove. Repeat the action, groove deepens. Deep grooves become default paths - thoughts flow there automatically.

Angry response to criticism? That's a groove. Do it enough, anger becomes your autopilot. Kind response to pain? Another groove. Practice it, kindness becomes natural.

No cosmic accountant needed. Just pattern reinforcement - same mechanism as learning piano or developing addiction. The universe doesn't punish or reward. You're programming yourself through repetition.

The twist: intention matters more than action. Accidentally stepping on ant? No groove. Deliberately crushing it? Groove forms. Same external act, different karmic weight, because intention carves the pattern.

This is why meditation works - you're literally re-grooving the mind. Each moment of awareness instead of reactivity creates new tracks. Eventually, the old grooves fill in from disuse.
