# Consciousness Stream

## Core Insight
Mind isn't a container holding thoughts but the stream itself - no riverbank, just flowing.

## The Stream Nature

Common mistake: thinking consciousness is the screen where experiences appear. But where's this screen? Look directly - find only the experiences themselves arising and passing. The knowing and the known arise together, inseparable.

Buddha's radical insight: consciousness (vijnana) isn't constant background but arises fresh with each contact. Eye meets form - eye consciousness arises. Ear meets sound - ear consciousness. No permanent watcher, just six streams of knowing (five senses plus mind-sense) flickering on and off billions of times per second.

Like film creating motion from still frames, continuity is constructed from discrete moments. Each mind-moment: contact, feeling, perception, intention, attention. Too fast to catch, but meditation slows the frame rate until you see the flicker.

The stream metaphor: water molecules constantly changing but pattern persists. Yesterday's river gone but river continues. Your consciousness now isn't same as five minutes ago, but the stream flows on. Death? Stream continues into new configuration, like river reaching ocean.

This is why Buddhism speaks of rebirth without soul. No fixed entity transmigrates, but the stream doesn't end at death - it just can't, any more than energy disappears. It reconfigures based on its momentum (karma) at transition point.
