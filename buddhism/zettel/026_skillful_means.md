# Skillful Means (Upaya)

## Core Insight
Truth adapts its expression to the listener's capacity - like water taking the shape of its container while remaining water.

## The Teaching Technology

Buddha didn't give same teaching to everyone. To materialists, he taught karma and rebirth. To eternalists, he taught impermanence. To nihilists, he taught Buddha-nature. Same truth, different angles.

Like doctor prescribing different medicines for different illnesses, though health is singular goal. Aspirin for headache, insulin for diabetes - giving insulin to headache patient isn't compassionate, it's dangerous.

This is why Buddhism has 84,000 different teachings (traditional number). Not confusion but precision. Each being stuck in unique way, needs unique unsticking. What liberates one might bind another.

Examples: Zen master shouts to shock student from concepts. Theravadin teaches precise mindfulness to calm scattered mind. Tantric uses desire itself as path. Pure Land offers faith to those who can't meditate. All pointing to same moon, from different angles.

The highest skillful means: sometimes not teaching Buddhism at all. Maybe someone needs therapy first, or food, or simple friendship. The bodhisattva becomes whatever helps - bridge, boat, or sometimes just silent presence.
