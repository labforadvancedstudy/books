# Abhidhamma (Mind Mapping)

## Core Insight
Abhidhamma is Buddhism's systematic phenomenology - an exhaustive categorization of consciousness into 89/121 distinct states, mapping the territory of mind with scientific precision.

## The Periodic Table of Consciousness

Where Western psychology stayed vague, Abhidhamma got specific. Not just "happy" but 24 types of wholesome consciousness, each with precise mental factors. Like chemists identifying elements, monks identified mind-moments.

Consciousness (citta) never alone - always accompanied by mental factors (cetasika). Universal factors present in every mind-moment: contact, feeling, perception, volition, one-pointedness, life faculty, attention. Then variable factors: greed, hatred, delusion, or their opposites.

The analysis: 89 types of consciousness. 52 mental factors. Infinite combinations. Each lasting billionths of second, arising and passing seventeen times faster than material phenomena. Mind-stream not river but machine-gun fire of discrete moments.

Example: You see chocolate. Eye-consciousness arises (just seeing brown). Mind-door consciousness identifies "chocolate." Feeling arises (pleasant). Greed may arise. Volition forms. Action follows. All this in microseconds, usually below awareness threshold.

Practical application: meditators learn to recognize mind-states as they arise. "This is consciousness rooted in greed... this is consciousness rooted in wisdom." Like chemist recognizing compounds by their properties. No judgment, just precise identification.

The paradox: this massive categorization system ultimately points to anatta - no permanent self orchestrating the show, just impersonal mental factors arising through conditions.
