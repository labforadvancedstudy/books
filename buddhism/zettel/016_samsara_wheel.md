# Samsara Wheel

## Core Insight
Samsara isn't just literal rebirth but the endless cycle of grasping and disappointment happening right now in this moment.

## The Spinning Mechanism

Literal samsara: beings dying and reborn across six realms - gods, titans, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings. Driven by karma, consciousness streams from form to form. Endless wandering through states of experience.

Psychological samsara: happening faster than heartbeat. Desire arises, we grasp, get it, feel momentary satisfaction, then emptiness, then new desire. The wheel spins. Check your last hour - how many mini-births and deaths? Hope/disappointment, excitement/boredom, attraction/aversion.

The six realms psychologically: god realm (pride/bliss), titan (jealousy/competition), human (desire/busyness), animal (ignorance/instinct), hungry ghost (insatiable craving), hell (rage/hatred). We cycle through all six before lunch.

The wheel's hub: ignorance, greed, hatred - three animals chasing tails. Spokes: twelve links of dependent origination. Rim: all possible experiences. Held by Yama, death lord, representing time itself. But look - Buddha points outside the wheel. There's an exit.

Samsara and nirvana: same reality, different recognition. Samsara is nirvana misperceived. Nirvana is samsara correctly understood. The wheel only spins in confusion.
