# Pure Land (Other Power)

## Core Insight
Pure Land reverses the self-power assumption - salvation comes not through personal effort but through surrendering to Amitabha Buddha's infinite compassion.

## The Infinite Compassion Hack

Most Buddhism: work out your own salvation. Meditate harder. Perfect morality. Accumulate merit. Lifetime after lifetime climbing the mountain. Pure Land: the mountain comes to you.

Amitabha's vow: anyone who calls his name with sincere faith gets reborn in Pure Land - ideal conditions for enlightenment. No hell realms, no hunger, no aging. Like cosmic kindergarten where everyone eventually graduates.

"Namo Amitabha Buddha" - millions chanting daily. Not magic spell but consciousness tuning. Like frightened child calling "mother" - the calling itself creates connection. Faith not as belief but as letting go into something larger.

The paradox: giving up self-power is highest self-power. Ego can't transcend ego through ego's effort. Like pulling yourself up by bootstraps. But surrendering ego to Other Power - that works. Jiriki (self-power) vs. Tariki (other-power) - ultimately non-dual.

Japanese innovation: even one sincere nembutsu enough. Shinran's insight - if practice required, poor and busy excluded. Radical democratization. Fisherman equal to monk. Revolutionary in feudal society.

Critics call it devotional degeneration. Supporters say it's Buddhism's bhakti yoga - liberation through love. Different door, same house. Some need meditation, others need devotion.
