# Mind Ground

## Core Insight
Before thoughts, emotions, or perceptions - the aware space in which all experience arises, plays, and dissolves.

## The Primordial Awareness

What knows you're reading? Not the thoughts about reading, not the eyes seeing, not the brain processing. The knowing itself - what is that? Turn attention around 180 degrees. What looks? Can't find it, yet undeniably present.

This is mind-ground (alaya): not personal consciousness but awareness itself. Like mirror that reflects everything but remains unmarked. Angry face, loving face - mirror unchanged. Your whole life story appeared in this awareness - births, deaths, joys, traumas - while awareness itself never moved.

Dzogchen calls it rigpa. Zen, original face. Vedanta, witness. Different fingers, same moon. The space where universe experiences itself. Not your awareness or my awareness - just awareness, temporarily focused through apparent separate points.

Here's where Buddhism gets wild: this ground isn't separate from appearances. Waves are ocean waving. Thoughts are awareness thinking. The ground doesn't witness experience from outside - it manifests AS experience. The play of emptiness and luminosity.

Death? Body dies, personal consciousness ends, but what about this ground? Like asking where space goes when building collapses. The question reveals the confusion. This is the deathless Buddha spoke of - not immortal person but the unborn nature of awareness itself.
