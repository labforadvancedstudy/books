# Breath Awareness

## Core Insight
The breath is always now - you can't breathe in the past or future.

## The Practice

In. Out. In. Out.

Not thinking about breathing. Not analyzing the diaphragm's movement. Just this inhale happening right... now. This exhale releasing right... now.

The breath is the universe's simplest teaching tool. It requires nothing - no temple, no teacher, no belief system. A child can do it. A dying person does it. You're doing it while reading this.

Watch: the cool air entering nostrils. The brief pause. The warm air leaving. Another pause. The rhythm that's been with you since birth, will be with you until death. So obvious we forget it. So simple we overlook it.

When the mind drifts to tomorrow's meeting or yesterday's argument, the breath calls you back: "Here. Now. This." It's an anchor in the storm of thoughts, a home you carry everywhere.
