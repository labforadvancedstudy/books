# Nirvana Extinction

## Core Insight
Nirvana isn't a place or state but the extinguishing of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion - what remains when nothing is added.

## The Unconditioned

Everything we know exists conditionally - if this, then that. Hot exists relative to cold, happiness to sadness, existence to non-existence. But nirvana? Unconditioned. Not dependent on anything. Neither existence nor non-existence.

Buddha's word "nibbana" literally: "blowing out" - like candle flame extinguished. Not the candle vanishing into void but the fire no longer burning. What's left? The unburnt. The peaceful. The deathless.

Two aspects: Nirvana with remainder (enlightened but still in body) and without remainder (after final death). First: fires out but lamp remains. Second: even the lamp done, but not into nothingness - into the unconditioned which was always already there.

Can't describe it positively. Every word adds something, but nirvana is when nothing is added. Can only say what it's not: not born, not become, not made, not conditioned. Yet Buddha insists: it IS. Most real thing there is. Realer than reality.

The paradox breaks language: How can extinguishing be fulfillment? How can emptiness be fullness? How can ending be deathless? Stop trying to think it. This is why zen masters throw shoes.
