# Koan (Breaking Logic)

## Core Insight
Koans are logical paradoxes designed to short-circuit conceptual thinking, forcing consciousness to leap beyond dualistic reasoning into direct realization.

## The Impossible Question

"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Logic breaks. Mind searches for answer, finds none. Keeps searching. Pressure builds. Like computer program hitting infinite loop, system overheats.

But that's the point. Koan isn't puzzle to solve but ram to break down the gate. The seeking itself transforms the seeker. Months, years, holding impossible question until something cracks.

"Show me your original face before your parents were born." Time collapses. How can you exist before existing? Mind ties itself in knots trying to think its way out. Can't go forward, can't go back. Stuck.

In that stuckness, opening appears. Not through logic but despite it. Sudden seeing - "Ah!" The answer was never conceptual. Like asking "What color is the number seven?" - wrong category entirely.

Master asks: "Does a dog have Buddha nature?" Student discovers answer isn't yes or no but the dissolution of the question itself. The asking mind dies, something else emerges.

Working with koan like holding hot iron ball in throat - can't swallow, can't spit out. That burning impossibility becomes gateway beyond thought-constructed reality.
