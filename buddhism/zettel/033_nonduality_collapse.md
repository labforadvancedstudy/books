# Nonduality Collapse

## Core Insight
Subject and object, self and world, samsara and nirvana - all conceptual divisions in seamless experiencing that never had gaps.

## The False Split

Every experience seems to have experiencer and experienced. "I see tree." But investigate: where's the boundary between seer and seen? At the eye? In the brain? In consciousness? The boundary can't be found because it's conceptually imposed after the fact.

In raw experience before thinking: just "treeing" happening. The green, the shape, the knowing of it - arising together as single event. Mind splits it later into subject/object for practical navigation, then forgets it did the splitting.

This isn't philosophical position but direct pointing. Right now - sound of traffic, sensation of breathing, these words appearing - where's the you separate from this experiencing? Can only find the idea of separation, not separation itself.

Advaita (not-two): not saying everything is one (that's still concept) but that the two-ness is conceptual addition. Like waves and ocean - not separate, not same, but the question itself misconstrues the situation.

Final collapse: even duality and nonduality are conceptual categories. Reality doesn't know these words. It just does what it does - this present experiencing, before the mind divides it into this and that.
