# Bodhisattva Vow

## Core Insight
The impossible commitment to save all beings becomes possible when you realize there are no beings and no one to save them.

## The Paradox Path

"Beings are numberless, I vow to save them all." Mathematically absurd. New beings born faster than you could save them. Universe expanding, potentially infinite sentient life. The vow is literally impossible.

That's the point.

The rational mind breaks against this paradox, and something else emerges: boundless compassion that doesn't calculate. Like mother rushing into burning building - she doesn't count children first.

Bodhisattva postpones final nirvana to help others. But deeper teaching: realizes self and other are constructions. Saving "others" is saving aspects of the same awareness. Your liberation and mine aren't separate events.

The vow transforms the practitioner. Instead of seeking personal escape, every action becomes offering. Meditation isn't for my peace but to become more helpful. Wisdom isn't for my understanding but to guide others. The path itself becomes service.

Cosmic joke revealed: the moment you truly commit to saving all beings, you realize the nature of being itself. The vow fulfills itself by dissolving the illusion of separate beings needing salvation. Everyone already Buddha, just temporarily confused.
