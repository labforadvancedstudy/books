# Eightfold Path

## Core Insight
Not eight separate steps but eight aspects of one coherent way of living - like eight facets of a single jewel.

## The Integration

Right View: See things as they are (impermanent, interconnected)
Right Intention: Align your will with reality 
Right Speech: Words that heal rather than harm
Right Action: Do what reduces suffering
Right Livelihood: Earn without exploitation
Right Effort: Balance between trying and forcing
Right Mindfulness: Stay present to what is
Right Concentration: Gather the scattered mind

"Right" (samma) doesn't mean morally correct - it means "complete" or "coherent." Like tuning an instrument until it rings true.

They spiral into each other: Better view leads to better intentions. Better intentions shape speech and action. Ethical living calms the mind. Calm mind sees more clearly. Clearer seeing improves view. Round and round, deepening.

It's not linear progress but circular deepening. A beginner's "right speech" differs from a master's, yet both are practicing the same principle at different depths.
