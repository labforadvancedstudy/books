# Pratityasamutpada (Dependent Origination Web)

## Core Insight
Nothing exists independently - everything arises through interconnected conditions, like notes existing only in relation to other notes.

## The Web Structure

"This is, because that is. This is not, because that is not. This ceases, that ceases."

Take a flower. It exists because: seed met soil, rain fell, sun shone, no one picked it, temperature stayed in range, insects pollinated parent plant, millions of ancestors survived, Earth formed at right distance from sun... Remove any condition - no flower.

But those conditions themselves depend on other conditions. Infinite regress in all directions. No starting point, no independent essence. Just the vast web of mutual arising.

Your thoughts right now: neurons firing because chemicals released because proteins folded because genes expressed because food digested because plants grew because sun fusion because gravity because big bang because... what?

The twelve-link chain monks memorize? Just one slice through infinite web. Ignorance conditions formations conditions consciousness conditions name-and-form... But it's circular, not linear. No first cause, just the wheel spinning.

This is why Buddhism has no creator god. Creation requires standing outside the web. But nothing stands outside. Even gods arise through conditions.
