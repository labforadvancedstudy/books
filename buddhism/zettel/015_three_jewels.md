# Three Jewels (Triple Gem)

## Core Insight
Buddha, Dharma, Sangha aren't external refuges but three aspects of awakening potential: teacher, teaching, and community of practice.

## The Three Refuges

Buddha: Not just historical Gautama but awakened nature itself. Taking refuge in Buddha means trusting that awakening is possible because someone did it. The possibility proven by actuality. Every Buddha was once confused like us.

Dharma: The teaching, but also the truth it points to. The map and the territory. Dharma exists whether Buddha teaches it or not - gravity worked before Newton. Taking refuge in dharma means trusting reality's workability, that truth can be discovered.

Sangha: Originally enlightened disciples, now broader community. Those walking ahead, beside, even behind you on path. Taking refuge in sangha means not going alone. Even hermits carry internal sangha - remembered teachers, imagined companions.

Why "jewels"? Rare, precious, but also clear. Diamond cuts through illusion. These three cut through spiritual materialism, blind faith, isolation. Not worshipping externals but recognizing: teacher-nature within, truth accessible now, companions everywhere.

The refuge formula "Buddham saranam gacchami" isn't pledge of allegiance but statement of direction. Like plant turning toward sun - natural movement toward what nourishes growth.
