# Vipassana (Seeing Through)

## Core Insight
Vipassana meditation systematically deconstructs experience into component sensations, revealing the impermanent, selfless nature of all phenomena through direct observation.

## The Microscope of Mind

Start with body scan. Not relaxation - investigation. What is "pain" in your knee? Look closer. Pressure, heat, pulsing, tightness. Look closer still. Vibrations, arising-passing, arising-passing. Solid pain dissolves into dance of sensations.

Now emotions. "Anger" seems solid, permanent. But watch: heat in chest, tension in jaw, thoughts spinning stories. Each component arising, changing, passing. The angry "self" nowhere to be found - just aggregates temporarily bundled.

Goenka's technique: systematic sweeping. Head to toe, toe to head. Notice sensations without reacting. Pleasant sensation? Don't grasp. Unpleasant? Don't push away. Equanimity with reality as it is.

The breakthrough: experiencing anicca directly. Not intellectual understanding but felt knowing - everything vibrating, dissolving, reforming. Even consciousness itself - discontinuous moments arising and passing like frames of film creating illusion of continuity.

Advanced practitioners report experiencing bhanga (dissolution) - body boundaries disappear, only flowing sensations remain. Self-view cannot survive this direct seeing.
