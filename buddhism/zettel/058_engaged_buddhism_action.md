# Engaged Buddhism (Awakened Action)

## Core Insight
Engaged Buddhism refuses the meditation cushion as escape, insisting liberation includes transforming social structures that perpetuate suffering.

## The Bodhisattva in the Streets

Thich Nhat Hanh, Vietnam War: monks self-immolating not from despair but compassion. The image sears global consciousness. Suddenly Buddhism not just quiet temples but burning protest. "When bombs fall on people, you cannot stay in meditation hall."

The revision: personal suffering and social suffering intertwined. Meditate on empty stomach - different insights than full belly. Systemic oppression creates dukkha. Liberation must address both internal and external conditions.

Sulak Sivaraksa: "Traditional Buddhism too individualistic. Modern Buddhism must engage structures." Buddhist economics, environmental activism, prison meditation, conflict resolution. Dharma applied to capitalism, racism, climate crisis.

The tension: activism can increase agitation, attachment to outcomes. How to act without creating more karma? Answer: action from emptiness. Protest without hatred. Reform without self-righteousness. The middle way between indifference and rage.

Examples multiplying: Buddhist Peace Fellowship, Green Buddhism, Buddhist feminism. Meditation flash mobs at Wall Street. Monks protecting forests with ordination ceremonies for trees. Zen hospices teaching death practice.

Critics say it's Buddhism diluted, politicized. Supporters say Buddha himself engaged social issues - challenging caste, creating sangha as alternative society. The monastery was always social experiment.
