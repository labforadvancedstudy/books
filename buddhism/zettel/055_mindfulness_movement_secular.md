# Mindfulness Movement (Secular Extraction)

## Core Insight
Western mindfulness extracted meditation from Buddhism like isolating active ingredient from plant medicine - powerful but missing the synergistic whole.

## The Great Extraction

Jon Kabat-Zinn, 1979: strips vipassana of Buddhism, rebrands as MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction). Suddenly hospitals teaching meditation. No rebirth, no karma, no liberation - just stress reduction and pain management.

The formula: present-moment awareness + non-judgment = mindfulness. Clean, secular, scientifically testable. Brain scans show thickened prefrontal cortex, reduced amygdala reactivity. Insurance companies approve. Corporate training rooms embrace.

What survived translation: basic attention training, body awareness, observing thoughts without attachment. What got lost: ethical framework, liberation goal, community support, devotional elements, cosmological context.

The paradox: secularization enabled massive spread but created "McMindfulness" - meditation as productivity tool. Buddha's path to end suffering becomes Silicon Valley's path to optimized performance. Executives meditate to be better at firing people mindfully.

Yet something profound happened: millions experiencing altered states previously reserved for monastics. Apps guiding more meditation sessions than all Buddhist history combined. Quantity has quality of its own.

The backlash: Buddhist teachers pointing out mindfulness without ethics is amoral. Like teaching martial arts techniques without philosophy - creates skilled but potentially harmful practitioners. Awareness without wisdom, presence without compassion.
