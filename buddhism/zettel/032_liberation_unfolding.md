# Liberation Unfolding

## Core Insight
Freedom isn't gained but recognized - like space that was always there once you stop building walls.

## The Unbinding Process

Liberation (vimutti) literally means "unbinding" - like loosening knots that seemed permanent. Not adding something new but removing what obscures. The sun doesn't need to be created, just uncovered.

Four stages traditionally: Stream-entry (seeing the path), Once-returner (weakening attachments), Non-returner (ending sensual desire), Arahat (complete unbinding). But these are snapshots of continuous process, like marking mile-posts on gradient slope.

The first glimpse (stream-entry): personality view drops, doubt about path vanishes, attachment to rules/rituals ends. Not through belief but direct seeing - like finally understanding optical illusion. Can't go back to not-seeing.

What drops away: the constant story-telling, the exhausting self-maintenance, the background anxiety of protecting illusion. What remains: awareness, responsiveness, natural compassion. Actions continue but no actor. Experiences arise but no experiencer to suffer them.

Strange paradox: greatest effort leads to effortlessness. Years of practice to realize there's nothing to practice. Seeking ends when seeker dissolves. The cosmic joke: you were free all along but needed the journey to realize it.
