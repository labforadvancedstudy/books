# Buddhist Cosmology (Reality Layers)

## Core Insight
Buddhist cosmology maps not physical space but states of consciousness - thirty-one planes of existence representing different configurations of desire, form, and formlessness.

## The Vertical Universe

Forget astronomy. This is psycho-cosmology. The universe structured by mental states, not gravity. Bottom to top: increasing refinement of consciousness.

Lower realms: hell beings (pure hatred), hungry ghosts (insatiable craving), animals (ignorance), humans (mixed), asuras (jealousy), devas (sensual pleasure). Not places but experiential domains. You've been in all of them - sometimes in single day.

Human realm: unique balance. Enough suffering to motivate, enough happiness to practice. Devas too blissed out to seek liberation. Hell beings too tormented. Animals too ignorant. Humans just right - the goldilocks zone for awakening.

Above desire realms: form realms. Beings of subtle light, sustained by meditation not food. Sixteen levels corresponding to jhana attainments. Your deep meditation literally takes you there - not metaphorically but experientially.

Highest: formless realms. No body, pure consciousness. Infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Sounds abstract until you experience it in meditation. Then cosmology becomes phenomenology.

The kicker: all impermanent. Even gods die. Brahmas lasting eons eventually exhaust their karma. The wheel includes everything - no escape through cosmological ascent. Liberation means stepping off the wheel entirely.

Time scales: cosmic cycles (kalpas) so vast they're measured by metaphor. Mountain of iron, brushed by silk cloth once per century until worn away - that's one kalpa.
