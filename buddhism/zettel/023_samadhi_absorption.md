# Samadhi (Concentration Absorption)

## Core Insight
Consciousness can gather into single-pointed absorption where subject-object duality temporarily dissolves - like water becoming so still it disappears.

## The Gathering Process

Normal mind: scattered across hundred things. Worries, plans, songs, memories - all churning together. Like flashlight beam dancing around dark room, illuminating fragments.

Samadhi practice: gather the beam. Choose one object - breath, candle, mantra. Each time attention scatters, gently return. Return. Return. Ten thousand times, return.

Slowly, the mind settles. Like sediment in shaken water falling still. Thoughts continue arising but you stop chasing them. The object becomes clearer, more vivid. You're approaching access concentration.

Then something shifts. The effort to stay present drops away. Attention locks onto object naturally, like magnet to iron. This is first jhana - sustainable absorption. Bliss and joy arise, not from getting something but from mind's natural happiness when unified.

Deeper still: joy fades to contentment, then equanimity. Object and observer merge. In fourth jhana, breath becomes so subtle it seems to stop. Mind bright, aware, perfectly still. Like space itself meditating.
