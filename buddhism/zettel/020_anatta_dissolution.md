# Anatta (Self Dissolution)

## Core Insight
The self isn't an illusion - it's a process mistaken for a thing, like mistaking whirlpool for object rather than pattern.

## The Search Protocol

Buddha's method: Look for self. Really look. Is it the body? But body changes completely every seven years. Is it thoughts? They arise and pass without permission. Emotions? Even less stable. Consciousness? Just awareness arising with each sense contact.

It's like looking for "the forest." You find trees, soil, air, birds, fungi - everything except forest itself. Forest is just a label for the collection, not a thing among things.

"I am angry" - but where's the I? There's physical tension, hot thoughts, the urge to act. Anger is happening, but no findable angry person. Like saying "it's raining" - what's the "it" that rains?

This isn't nihilism. Processes exist, patterns persist, karma accumulates. But no fixed entity to own them. Like a university - students graduate, buildings renovate, but Oxford continues. Continuity without permanence.

The liberation: if no fixed self exists, you're not stuck being who you were. Each moment offers fresh possibility. The prison bars were painted on air.
