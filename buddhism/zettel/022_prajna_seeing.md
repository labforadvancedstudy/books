# Prajna (Wisdom Seeing)

## Core Insight
Wisdom isn't accumulated knowledge but direct seeing - the difference between knowing fire is hot and touching it.

## The Seeing Mode

Two types of knowing: conceptual and direct. You can study suffering for decades, memorize sutras, debate philosophy. That's pandita (learned). But prajna happens when you see your own grasping in real-time and it releases by itself.

Like those Magic Eye 3D pictures. Someone can explain the hidden image perfectly, but until your eyes suddenly shift and you see it yourself - no real understanding. Once seen, can't unsee.

Prajna sees three marks simultaneously: impermanent (anicca), suffering-prone (dukkha), selfless (anatta). Not as ideas but as immediate reality. Watch thought arise - already changing, can't satisfy, no owner found. That's prajna flickering.

It often comes in meditation when thinking stops. In the gap between thoughts, what knows? That knowing without concept - that's prajna operating. Clear, aware, but no subject-object split. The eye can't see itself but knows seeing is happening.

Wisdom traditions worldwide point here: gnosis, jnana, prajna, direct knowing. Beyond smart or stupid. The illiterate farmer might have it while the scholar misses it entirely.
