# Sila (Ethical Foundation)

## Core Insight
Ethics isn't about moral rules but creating conditions where the mind can settle - you can't meditate in a storm you created.

## The Practical Foundation

Try meditating after lying to someone. The mind churns with justification, worry, planning cover stories. Try finding peace after harming someone. Guilt and fear create static. The mind can't settle in self-generated turbulence.

Sila isn't morality imposed from outside - it's engineering for inner peace. Don't kill, steal, lie, intoxicate, or misuse sexuality. Not because sky-father forbids it, but because these create mental chaos.

Like a scientist preparing clean lab conditions. You wouldn't run delicate experiments during earthquake. Similarly, you can't investigate mind's nature while it's disturbed by ethical aftershocks.

The precepts are training wheels, not prison bars. Eventually, harmlessness becomes natural - not because you follow rules but because you see clearly how harm boomerangs back as mental disturbance. Clarity itself becomes the ethics.
