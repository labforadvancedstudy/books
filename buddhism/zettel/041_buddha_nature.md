# Buddha Nature

## Core Insight
Awakening isn't achievement but uncovering what was always present - like sun always shining above the clouds.

## The Always Already

Later Buddhist insight: if enlightenment were truly gained, it would be conditioned, impermanent. What's gained can be lost. So liberation must be recognition of what was never missing.

Buddha-nature (tathagatagarbha): the womb/embryo of thus-gone-one. Present in all beings like butter hidden in milk. Not potential to become Buddha but already being Buddha, temporarily obscured. The clouds don't damage sun - just hide it from view.

This shifts everything. Practice isn't building something but removing obstacles. Like archaeologist uncovering ancient statue - each brushstroke reveals what was there. Meditation, ethics, wisdom - all just removing dust.

Why don't we see it? The nature of obscuration is to hide itself. Fish doesn't know water, eye can't see itself. Buddha-nature so intimate, so constant, we miss it looking elsewhere. Seeking it maintains the very separation preventing recognition.

The cosmic joke deepens: Sentient beings are Buddha, seeking Buddha, unable to find Buddha because busy being Buddha while looking for Buddha. The seeking itself is Buddha-nature functioning.
