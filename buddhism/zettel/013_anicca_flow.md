# Anicca (Impermanence Flow)

## Core Insight
Not that things end, but that things never stop changing - reality is verb, not noun.

## The River Teaching

You can't step in the same river twice - but Buddhism goes further: you can't step in the same river once. By the time your foot hits bottom, it's already different water.

Your body: 50 trillion cells, millions dying and birthing each second. The you reading this sentence isn't the you who started it. Your thoughts: already gone before you notice them. That anger from yesterday? Can't find it except as memory of memory.

Mountains seem permanent - watch geology footage sped up. They flow like waves. Stars seem eternal - they're just slow explosions. Even atoms vibrate, electrons dance. Nothing holds still except in the frozen photograph of concept.

This isn't depressing - it's liberating. That mistake you're holding onto? Already gone, only memory remains. That success you're clinging to? Evaporated. You're free in each moment because each moment is fresh.

The problem: we keep trying to hold water. The solution: become water.
