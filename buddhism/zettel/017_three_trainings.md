# Three Trainings (Sila-Samadhi-Panna)

## Core Insight
Ethics, concentration, and wisdom form a triple helix - each strand supporting and strengthened by others, spiraling toward liberation.

## The Integrated Training

Not sequential steps but simultaneous cultivation. Like learning instrument: posture (ethics), practice (concentration), and musical understanding (wisdom) develop together. Can't master one without others.

Sila (ethics): Creates calm environment for mind. No regrets, no guilt, no fear of consequences. Mind naturally settles when not disturbed by ethical turbulence. Like preparing clean laboratory for delicate experiment.

Samadhi (concentration): Gathers scattered attention into coherent beam. With ethical foundation, mind stabilizes easily. Concentrated mind sees clearly, like still water reflects perfectly. This clarity naturally generates wisdom.

Panna (wisdom): Sees things as they are - impermanent, selfless, interdependent. This seeing naturally leads to ethical behavior (why harm what's interconnected?) and easier concentration (less grasping = less agitation).

The spiral effect: Initial ethics enables basic concentration, which glimpses wisdom, which refines ethics, which deepens concentration, which clarifies wisdom... Round and round, higher and higher.

Western psychology now discovering this: mindfulness (samadhi) increases emotional regulation (sila) and insight (panna). Buddhism mapped this territory 2,500 years ago.
