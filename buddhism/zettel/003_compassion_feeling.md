# Compassion Feeling

## Core Insight
Compassion isn't a thought - it's that warm melting in your chest when you see suffering.

## The Warmth

A child falls and scrapes their knee. Before you think "I should help," something moves in you. That movement - that's karuna in its raw form.

It's not pity (looking down), not empathy (feeling their pain as yours). It's simpler: the heart's natural response to pain, like a mother turning toward her crying infant at 3am. No decision. Just turning.

Watch a dog lick its wounded packmate. See strangers rush to help after an accident. This isn't learned morality or religious training - it's deeper. Evolution? Buddha-nature? Doesn't matter. The warmth is there before the explanations.

The weird part: you can feel it for yourself too. That same warmth can turn inward toward your own scrapes and failures. Same feeling, different direction. The heart doesn't discriminate - it just knows how to care.
