# Representation

## Core Insight
Democracy's scaling hack - few people stand in for many, losing information at each step.

Representation solves democracy's bandwidth problem by compression: millions choose hundreds who decide everything. But compression loses information. Your representative votes on thousands of issues you've never considered, claims to represent your "interests" without knowing what you think about most questions.

The fiction necessary: representatives somehow embody the will of constituents despite mathematical impossibility. No aggregation function can preserve individual preferences. We accept this because direct democracy is computationally impossible at scale. Representation isn't democracy perfected, it's democracy approximated - a lossy compression algorithm we pretend is lossless.
