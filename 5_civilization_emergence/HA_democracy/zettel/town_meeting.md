# Town Meeting

## Core Insight
Democracy's original form - direct participation that doesn't scale beyond Dunbar's number.

The New England town meeting represents democracy at human scale: everyone speaks, everyone hears, decisions emerge through actual dialogue. This works for ~150 people who share context, breaks catastrophically at city scale. The fundamental bandwidth limitation: human attention and processing power.

Ancient Athens tried to scale this with random sampling (sortition), creating representative microcosms. Modern democracy abandoned the attempt, replacing dialogue with voting. We kept the ideal of "government by discussion" while removing actual discussion. Town meetings reveal what we lost: immediate feedback, visible consequences, social accountability.
