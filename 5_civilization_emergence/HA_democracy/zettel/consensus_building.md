# Consensus Building

## Core Insight
Democracy's holy grail - unanimous agreement through dialogue. Possible in small groups, mythical at scale.

Consensus-building works when participants share goals, context, and commitment to process. Quaker meetings, Japanese nemawashi, indigenous councils show it's possible. But these require shared culture, unlimited time, and genuine goodwill. Scale kills consensus: more people means more interests, less shared context, impossibility of meaningful dialogue.

Modern democracy pretends to seek consensus while operating through conflict. "Bipartisan" means two parties agreed, ignoring everyone else. We use consensus rhetoric to legitimize majority dominance. True consensus-building is pre-democratic technology, requiring conditions democracy destroys: small scale, cultural unity, time abundance.
