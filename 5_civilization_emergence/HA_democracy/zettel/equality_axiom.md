# Equality Axiom

## Core Insight
Democracy's noble lie - that all citizens are equal participants despite vast differences in capability, interest, and impact.

"One person, one vote" assumes equality that doesn't exist. Some understand issues deeply, others not at all. Some have skin in the game, others vote casually. Some shaped by decisions for decades, others barely affected. Democracy flattens these differences into identical voting weights.

This isn't bug but feature - alternative is worse. Who decides who gets more say? Any system weighting votes by competence/stake/impact creates new inequalities, often worse. So democracy embraces false equality as least-bad option. The axiom violates reality but alternatives violate it worse. Over-technology again: implementing equality before knowing how to measure or achieve it.
