# Ballot Box

## Core Insight
Physical container for democratic inputs - a primitive database before we understood data storage.

The ballot box represents democracy's attempt to create a trusted information repository using physical security rather than cryptographic protocols. Sealed, guarded, witnessed - all analog solutions to the digital problem of verifiable data collection. Ancient Greeks dropped pottery shards, we use paper or electrons, but the core challenge remains: how to collect authentic preferences while preventing tampering?

The box is democracy's first technology stack: input device (ballot), storage medium (box), access control (seal), audit trail (witnesses). We invented the interface before understanding the backend processing requirements.
