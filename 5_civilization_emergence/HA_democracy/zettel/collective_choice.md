# Collective Choice

## Core Insight
Democracy's central fiction - that groups can "choose" like individuals, despite mathematical impossibility.

Individual choice seems coherent: preferences ordered, decisions made. But groups aren't individuals. Arrow's theorem proves no aggregation method can preserve individual rationality at group level. Collective "choice" always violates someone's logic, creates cycles, depends on arbitrary procedures.

Yet we must decide collectively. Democracy pretends group choices reflect "the people's will" - a mystical entity that doesn't exist. Really we're using arbitrary procedures (majority vote, representative delegation, judicial review) to generate outcomes we label "collective choice." The over-technology: implementing group decision-making before understanding it's logically impossible.
