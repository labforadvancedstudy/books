# Future Democracy

## Core Insight
Democracy's next evolution requires transcending voting - moving from preference aggregation to genuine collective intelligence.

Future democracy might look like: prediction markets for policy, AI-mediated deliberation, continuous feedback loops, liquid delegation, quadratic voting, futarchy. Each addresses specific failures: markets reveal information, AI processes complexity, feedback enables learning, delegation balances expertise with participation.

But path dependence is powerful. Existing democracies resist fundamental change. Revolutionary replacement seems impossible without catastrophe. More likely: gradual hybridization, democracy absorbing new mechanisms while maintaining voting theater. The over-technology persists, patched rather than replaced, because social systems have more inertia than technical ones.
