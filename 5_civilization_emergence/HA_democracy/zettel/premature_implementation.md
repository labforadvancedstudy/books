# Premature Implementation

## Core Insight
Democracy's original sin - deploying alpha software in production environments for two millennia.

Software wisdom: premature optimization is evil, but premature deployment is catastrophic. Democracy shipped before basic features worked. No user authentication (voter verification), no data validation (fact-checking), no error handling (peaceful transitions), no scalability (beyond city-states). Each society that tried democracy had to build missing features from scratch.

The result: democracy's history is mostly failure. Athens lasted decades, Rome's republic centuries, but both collapsed. Modern democracy survives through constant patching - adding courts for error handling, bureaucracy for processing, media for information flow. We're maintaining legacy code nobody fully understands, written for hardware that no longer exists, serving users it wasn't designed for.
