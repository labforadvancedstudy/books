# Voting Paradoxes

## Core Insight
Mathematical proofs that democratic voting is fundamentally broken - not flawed implementation but logical impossibility.

Condorcet's paradox: majorities can prefer A>B, B>C, and C>A simultaneously. Arrow's impossibility: no voting system satisfies basic fairness criteria. Gibbard-Satterthwaite: strategic voting is always rational. These aren't bugs, they're features - mathematical properties of collective choice.

We discovered these paradoxes after implementing democracy, like finding physics violations after building the machine. The response? Ignore them. We use majority rule knowing it creates cycles, hold elections knowing strategic voting distorts results. Democracy is over-technology par excellence: a logical impossibility we implement anyway because alternatives seem worse.
