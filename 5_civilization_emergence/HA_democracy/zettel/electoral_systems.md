# Electoral Systems

## Core Insight
Democracy's operating system - the rules that transform votes into power, each creating different distortions.

First-past-the-post creates two-party dominance. Proportional representation fragments into coalitions. Ranked choice enables third parties but complexifies strategy. Each system incentivizes different behaviors, creates different pathologies. There's no neutral choice - the electoral system shapes the democracy it enables.

We debate electoral reform as if finding the "right" system, but it's choosing between failure modes. Every system distorts preferences differently, advantages different groups, encourages different strategies. Electoral systems are democracy's source code, but we wrote them before understanding computation. Now we're stuck debugging production systems that can't be taken offline.
