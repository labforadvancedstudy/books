# Legitimacy Source

## Core Insight
Democracy's magic trick - transforming raw power into accepted authority through participatory ritual.

Governments need legitimacy to function without constant force. Monarchy claimed divine right, democracy claims popular sovereignty. But "the people" is fiction - no unified entity exists to grant authority. Democracy creates legitimacy through process: elections held, votes counted, winners declared. The ritual matters more than the result.

Legitimacy is collective hallucination maintained by participation. Even flawed elections legitimize if people participate. Even good policies fail without perceived legitimacy. Democracy discovered that involving people in choosing rulers makes them accept being ruled. It's psychological technology more than political - manufacturing consent through inclusion theater.
