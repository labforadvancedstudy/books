# Social Pressure

## Core Insight
The invisible force that builds when human needs meet systemic denial - revolution's dark energy.

Social pressure is potential energy of unmet needs. Every hungry child, every unpaid worker, every denied dignity adds pressure. Like atmospheric pressure, it's invisible until it isn't. You cannot see it, but you can measure its effects: crime rates rise, birth rates fall, suicide increases, trust collapses.

The pressure has components: economic (can't afford food), social (can't afford status), psychological (can't afford hope). These pressures multiply, not add. A person who's poor but respected survives. Poor and despised breaks. The multiplication creates non-linear effects - why revolutions surprise.

Critical insight: pressure requires container. Without state monopoly on violence, pressure dissipates through crime, feuds, warlords. Strong states contain pressure, enabling higher accumulation. Paradox: effective oppression creates conditions for total revolution. Weak states have riots; strong states have revolutions.
