# Liquidity Threshold

## Core Insight
The critical point where wealth becomes so concentrated it stops flowing - economic cardiac arrest preceding revolution.

Liquidity is money's velocity, its flow rate through economy. When wealth concentrates excessively, paradox emerges: the rich have all money but nothing to buy (already own everything); the poor need everything but have no money. Flow stops. Economy seizes like engine without oil.

The threshold is measurable: when top 1% spending cannot compensate for bottom 50% poverty. Rich buy yachts, but economy needs million refrigerators, not one superyacht. Velocity of money plummets. Each dollar circulates less. Economy cools despite monetary mass.

This creates revolution's economic precondition: assets without liquidity. French aristocrats had land but needed cash. Russian nobles had serfs but needed goods. When wealth cannot convert to needs, when money stops acting like money, the system prepares to reset through revolution.
