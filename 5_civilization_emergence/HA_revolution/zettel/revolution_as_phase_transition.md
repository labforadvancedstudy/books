# Revolution as Phase Transition

## Core Insight
Revolution is society's phase transition - same energy, different state, like water becoming steam.

Phase transitions are nature's discontinuities. Below 0°C: ice. Above 0°C: water. The transition is not gradual but binary. Revolution is identical: below critical pressure: obedience. Above critical pressure: rebellion. The society transforms state while conserving underlying human energy.

At transition point, strange phenomena: both states coexist. Like water at exactly 100°C - liquid and gas simultaneously. Revolutionary moments: old regime functions but no one believes; new order emerges but isn't yet real. Reality becomes quantum - superposition of states until observation (victory/defeat) collapses wave function.

The energy requirement is precise: latent heat of revolution. Energy must be added to break social bonds, overcome institutional inertia. This explains why revolutions require external shock (war, famine, scandal) - adding activation energy for phase transition.
