# Energy Welfare

## Core Insight
Future states prevent revolution through energy redistribution - guaranteed minimum energy/wealth as systemic stabilizer.

Energy welfare is revolution insurance. By guaranteeing minimum energy (money/resources) to all citizens, system prevents pressure accumulation that triggers revolution. Not charity but physics - maintaining sustainable gradient prevents catastrophic discharge.

The calculation is precise: welfare cost < revolution cost. Revolution destroys ~30-50% of society's wealth through violence, chaos, lost production. Annual 10% redistribution prevents 40% destruction every few decades. Pure economics, no morality required. Smart elites pay welfare; stupid elites pay with heads.

This explains modern stability. Societies with robust welfare (Nordics) have no revolutions. Societies without (Latin America, Africa) have regular upheavals. Welfare is society's pressure release valve - controlled venting preventing explosion. As inequality rises globally, energy welfare becomes not luxury but necessity for system survival.
