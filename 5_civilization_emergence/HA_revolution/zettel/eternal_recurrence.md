# Eternal Recurrence

## Core Insight
Revolution is not event in history but history's structure - the eternal return of inequality accumulation and violent correction.

History doesn't repeat but rhymes because it's computing same algorithm with different variables. Egyptian slaves, Roman plebeians, French sans-culottes, Russian proletarians - same function, different inputs. The revolution is not in time but is time's pattern. We experience linear progression but live in cyclical reality.

The recurrence is not identical but self-similar. Each cycle carries forward previous cycle's mutations. Technology changes, consciousness evolves, but pattern persists: accumulation → pressure → explosion → redistribution → accumulation. We're not escaping history but playing it at higher frequency.

Nietzsche glimpsed it: eternal return of same. But he missed the physics - it's not philosophical but thermodynamic. Any system capable of gradient accumulation must periodically discharge. Revolution is how human societies breathe. The question is not whether but when, not if but how violent.
