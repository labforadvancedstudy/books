# Friction Minimization

## Core Insight
Revolution accelerates by reducing social friction - the force resisting change drops until movement becomes frictionless.

Social friction is fear, habit, uncertainty cost. Normally, friction prevents revolution: fear of police, habit of obedience, uncertainty about aftermath. But friction erodes. Each successful protest reduces fear. Each revealed scandal breaks habit. Each regime weakness clarifies alternative.

The mechanics mirror physical friction. Static friction (before movement) exceeds kinetic friction (during movement). Starting revolution is hardest; once moving, it slides easier. This explains revolution's acceleration - not just momentum building, but friction declining.

Technology as lubricant: social media reduces coordination friction. Cryptocurrency reduces financial friction. Encryption reduces communication friction. Each technical advance makes revolution mechanically easier. The same grievances that produced nothing in 1920 produce revolution in 2020 because friction coefficient changed.
