# Tipping Point

## Core Insight
The exact moment when gradual becomes sudden - revolution's event horizon beyond which return impossible.

Tipping points are phase transition triggers. Water at 99°C is just hot water. At 100°C, it's steam. Revolution's the same: 999,999 angry people are a problem; 1,000,000 is a new reality. The difference isn't quantity but quality - the system's state space fundamentally shifts.

The mathematics are catastrophe theory. Small parameter change (one more protestor, one more grievance, one more death) pushes system across fold catastrophe. What was stable equilibrium becomes unstable. The marble balanced on hill's peak finally rolls.

Recognition: tipping points are visible only in retrospect. Before: "tension rising but manageable." After: "how did we not see?" But there are precursors - increasing volatility, slower recovery from disturbances, critical slowing down. Systems near tipping points oscillate wildly, desperately seeking stability that no longer exists.
