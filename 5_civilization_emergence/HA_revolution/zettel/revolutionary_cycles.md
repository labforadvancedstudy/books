# Revolutionary Cycles

## Core Insight
Revolution isn't event but phase in eternal cycle: accumulation → explosion → redistribution → accumulation.

Societies breathe through revolution cycles. Inhale: wealth accumulates, hierarchies solidify, energy concentrates. Hold: pressure builds, friction increases, system strains. Exhale: revolution erupts, energy redistributes, hierarchies flatten. Pause: new order stabilizes. Then inhale again.

The period varies but pattern doesn't. Short cycles (20-30 years): minor revolutions, reform movements, generational rebellion. Medium cycles (70-100 years): major revolutions, regime changes, constitutional crises. Long cycles (200-300 years): civilizational resets, total social transformation.

Why cycles? Because humans. We forget pain, romanticize past, believe "this time different." Each generation must learn limits directly. Also thermodynamics: any system accumulating energy eventually exceeds container strength. Revolution is not failure but feature - society's pressure release valve.
