# Power Structures

## Core Insight
Power architectures that channel human energy - invisible pyramids built from belief and backed by violence.

Power structures are energy flow diagrams. King at top doesn't rule through personal strength but because structure channels subjects' energy upward. Remove king, structure remains. This explains why revolutions often reproduce what they destroy - easier to occupy structure than rebuild it.

The architecture has physics: spans of control (how many one can command), hierarchical depth (layers of command), lateral connections (peer communication). Optimal structures balance vertical efficiency with horizontal resilience. Too vertical: brittle, snaps under pressure. Too horizontal: sluggish, cannot respond.

Revolution reveals structure's illusory nature. Palace guards flee - were they ever loyal or just performing? Ministers vanish - did they ever minister? The whole elaborate architecture, seemingly solid as stone, evaporates like morning mist when energy stops flowing through it.
