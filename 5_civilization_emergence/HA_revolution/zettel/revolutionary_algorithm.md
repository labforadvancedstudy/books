# Revolutionary Algorithm

## Core Insight
Revolution follows computable algorithm - inputs of inequality, outputs of violence, function of human constants.

The algorithm:
1. Measure wealth concentration (Gini coefficient)
2. Calculate pressure (unmet needs × population)
3. Assess container strength (state violence capacity)
4. Monitor network density (social connections)
5. When pressure/strength > 1, revolution initiates
6. Violence proportional to accumulated pressure
7. New equilibrium at lower inequality
8. Repeat from step 1

This is not metaphor but mechanics. Each variable is measurable. The function is deterministic. Given perfect information, revolution is predictable as weather - chaotic but bounded. We can't predict exact date but can predict conditions.

The algorithm is civilization's heartbeat. Each cycle pumps wealth up (accumulation phase) then violently redistributes (revolution phase). Without this pump, society stratifies into permanent castes. Revolution is not civilization's disease but its circulation.
