# Narrative Control

## Core Insight
Power is story control - revolution is narrative mutation, when new story overpowers old reality-encoding.

Every regime is sustained by narrative. Divine right, historical necessity, democratic mandate - stories that encode power as natural/inevitable. Citizens don't obey force primarily but story. Even police obey because they believe story of legitimate authority. Remove story, structure collapses.

Revolution begins in narrative space. New story emerges - "we are oppressed," "they are corrupt," "change is possible." Stories compete for believers. When new story captures critical mass of belief, reality reshapes to match. Physical revolution follows narrative revolution; the fighting just updates material world to match new story.

Digital acceleration: narrative mutations spread at light speed. Story that took years to spread now takes hours. Memes are narrative genes, evolving rapidly, selecting for maximum transmission and impact. Revolution becomes less about street fighting, more about story fighting. Who controls the narrative controls reality.
