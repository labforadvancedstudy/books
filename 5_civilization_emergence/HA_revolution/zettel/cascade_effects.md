# Cascade Effects

## Core Insight
Revolutionary contagion spreading through network geometry - each conversion lowering activation energy for neighbors.

Cascades are revolution's propagation mechanism. One person protests: isolated incident. Their friend joins: small disturbance. Friend's friends join: local unrest. Fourth degree: city rises. Fifth degree: nation transforms. The mathematics are network percolation - revolution spreads along social bonds like fire along fuses.

Critical factor: network density and clustering. Sparse networks: revolution fizzles, can't jump gaps. Dense networks: revolution explodes, multiple paths between nodes. Clustering coefficient determines speed - tight communities flip together, loose communities fragment.

The cascade is psychological and economic. Psychological: seeing others act reduces fear, increases shame of inaction. Economic: joining becomes cheaper as numbers grow (safety in numbers) while not joining becomes expensive (social isolation). The cascade accelerates until joining revolution cheaper than supporting regime.
