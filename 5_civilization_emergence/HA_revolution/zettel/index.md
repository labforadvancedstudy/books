# Revolution Zettelkasten Index

## Core Insight: Money = Energy, Revolution = Pressure Release

When wealth concentration exceeds critical thresholds, revolution occurs as inevitably as earthquakes release tectonic pressure. This zettelkasten explores revolution through physics lens.

## L1-L2: Observable Phenomena
- [[crowd_gathering]] - Physical accumulation of bodies
- [[violence_eruption]] - Kinetic energy release
- [[regime_collapse]] - Power structure failure
- [[symbols_falling]] - Meaning destruction

## L3: Patterns
- [[wealth_concentration]] - Money pooling dynamics
- [[social_pressure]] - Unmet needs accumulation
- [[critical_mass]] - Self-sustaining threshold
- [[tipping_point]] - Phase transition trigger

## L4: Mechanics
- [[money_as_energy]] - Wealth as literal social energy
- [[liquidity_threshold]] - Flow stoppage point
- [[friction_minimization]] - Resistance reduction
- [[energy_redistribution]] - Violent rebalancing

## L5: Systems
- [[revolutionary_cycles]] - Eternal accumulation/release
- [[power_structures]] - Energy channel architectures
- [[social_thermodynamics]] - Society's physics laws

## L6: Abstract Concepts
- [[revolution_as_phase_transition]] - State change physics
- [[energy_conservation_social]] - Nothing created/destroyed
- [[entropy_and_order]] - Decay and renewal
