# Entropy and Order

## Core Insight
Revolution resets social entropy temporarily, but universal arrow points toward disorder - order requires constant energy.

Every society is battle against entropy. Laws, institutions, hierarchies - all are negative entropy, ordered structures requiring energy to maintain. Without constant input (enforcement, belief, habit), they decay. Revolution is entropy winning temporarily - ordered structures collapsing to high-entropy chaos.

But paradox: humans cannot tolerate maximum entropy. Pure chaos is death. So immediately after destroying order, revolutionaries build new order. "Revolutionary government" is oxymoron that must exist. The new order starts low entropy (efficient, aligned, purposeful) but immediately begins accumulating disorder.

The entropy ratchet: each revolution resets to higher baseline entropy. Ancient kingdoms lasted millennia, medieval centuries, modern decades. Information acceleration means faster entropy accumulation. Future governments might last years. Revolution frequency increases as social metabolism accelerates.
