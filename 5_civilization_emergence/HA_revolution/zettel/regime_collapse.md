# Regime Collapse

## Core Insight
Power structures failing catastrophically when energy flow reverses - the moment servants stop serving.

Regimes don't fade, they shatter. One day the police obey orders, next day they join protesters. The transition is binary because power is relational - it exists only in the space between commander and commanded. When that space collapses, power vanishes instantly.

The observable pattern: periphery fails first. Border guards abandon posts. Tax collectors stop collecting. Provincial governors declare autonomy. The energy that flowed center-ward reverses, rushing back to edges. The capital, gorged on extracted energy, finds itself suddenly starved.

Most fascinating: the regime rarely sees it coming. They confuse the map (org charts, titles, laws) with territory (actual human compliance). Even as soldiers desert, they study military manuals. Even as people stop paying taxes, they debate tax policy. Reality has already shifted; they're governing ghosts.
