A revolution is a machine made of humans. Like any machine, it has components, mechanisms, and operating principles. Understanding these mechanics means understanding how societies disassemble and reassemble themselves.

## The Revolutionary Engine

Every revolution runs the same basic engine:

**Intake Stroke**: Grievances accumulate
**Compression Stroke**: Pressure builds through blocked channels  
**Ignition**: Triggering event provides spark
**Power Stroke**: Energy releases violently
**Exhaust Stroke**: New order stabilizes

The French Revolution cycled through this engine multiple times:
- 1789: First ignition (Estates-General to National Assembly)
- 1792: Second ignition (monarchy to republic)
- 1793: Third ignition (Girondins to Jacobins)
- 1794: Fourth ignition (Terror to Thermidor)

Each cycle more violent than the last, until exhaustion brought stability.

## The Catalyst Mechanism

Revolutions need catalysts - events that lower activation energy for change. Like enzymes in chemistry, catalysts don't cause revolution but make it possible at lower temperatures.

Common catalysts:
- Military defeat (Russia 1917: WWI losses)
- Economic shock (France 1789: bankruptcy)
- Natural disaster (Mexico 1910: drought)
- Symbolic outrage (Tunisia 2010: self-immolation)

The catalyst doesn't need to be large. Mohamed Bouazizi setting himself on fire wasn't objectively more significant than previous oppression. But at critical pressure, any spark ignites.

Catalyst efficiency formula:
Revolution Speed = k × e^(-Ea/RT)

Where Ea is activation energy, R is social resistance, T is temperature (unrest level). Catalysts reduce Ea dramatically.

## The Vanguard Function

Revolutions need a vanguard - a small group that moves first, shows it's possible, pays the early price.

Vanguard requirements:
1. **Commitment** > fear of death
2. **Vision** of alternative future
3. **Organization** to coordinate action
4. **Communication** to spread message

The vanguard doesn't represent the masses initially. They represent the future. The Jacobins were bourgeois lawyers imagining themselves as Roman republicans. The Bolsheviks were intellectuals cosplaying as workers.

Vanguard effectiveness = (Ideological Clarity) × (Organizational Discipline) × (Strategic Timing)

Too early: crushed easily. Too late: irrelevant. The art is reading social temperature precisely.

## Dual Power Dynamics

Before old power falls, new power must rise. This creates dual power - two authority systems claiming legitimacy simultaneously.

France 1789:
- Old: King, nobles, church
- New: National Assembly, communes, clubs

Russia 1917:
- Old: Provisional Government  
- New: Soviets (workers' councils)

Dual power is unstable. Like two objects can't occupy same space, two powers can't rule same territory. One must eliminate the other. Revolution is the collision.

The stronger power isn't who has more guns initially. It's who has more legitimacy. When soldiers stop obeying officers and start obeying soviets, revolution wins without firing.

## Institutional Collapse Sequence

Institutions don't fall randomly. They fall in predictable order:

1. **Legitimacy** erodes (ideological failure)
2. **Finance** breaks (can't pay functionaries)
3. **Security** wavers (military/police reliability drops)
4. **Administration** fragments (bureaucracy stops functioning)
5. **Law** disappears (courts can't enforce)
6. **Order** collapses (chaos reigns)

France followed exactly this sequence 1787-1789. So did Russia 1916-1917. So did every major revolution. 

Understanding the sequence allows prediction. When finance breaks, security wavering is ~6 months away. When administration fragments, collapse is ~3 months away.

## Revolutionary Momentum

Revolution has momentum = mass × velocity.

Mass = number of participants
Velocity = rate of change

Small mass moving fast (coup) can equal large mass moving slow (mass revolution). But momentum must exceed system inertia for change.

Momentum equation:
p = Σ(m_i × v_i)

Where each group i has mass m and velocity v. Urban workers might have low mass but high velocity. Peasants have high mass but low velocity. Successful revolutions unite different momentum vectors.

French Revolution succeeded by combining:
- Bourgeois lawyers (low mass, high velocity)
- Urban sans-culottes (medium mass, medium velocity)  
- Rural peasants (high mass, low velocity)

Total momentum overwhelmed system inertia.

## The Ratchet Effect

Revolutions move in ratchets - forward movement locks in, backward movement blocked.

Each revolutionary advance creates new facts:
- Bastille falls → royal authority questioned
- King flees → monarchy delegitimized
- King executed → no return possible

The ratchet works through commitment escalation. Once you've stormed a palace, you can't apologize. Once you've killed a king, you're committed. Each action forecloses retreat.

This explains revolutionary radicalization. Not ideological evolution but practical ratcheting. Each step requires next step for survival.

## Coalition Dynamics

Revolutions are coalitions of groups with different goals united by common enemy.

French Revolution coalition:
- Bourgeoisie wanted economic freedom
- Workers wanted bread prices controlled
- Peasants wanted feudalism ended
- Intellectuals wanted rights implemented

These goals contradict. But facing common enemy (Old Regime), contradictions defer. Post-revolution, coalition fragments as goals conflict.

Coalition stability formula:
Stability = (External Threat) / (Internal Contradictions)

High external threat: coalition holds
Low external threat: coalition explodes

This explains revolutionary phases. United to destroy. Divided to build. The Terror was coalition members eliminating each other once external threat reduced.

## Information Cascade Mechanics

Revolutions spread through information cascades. Person A acts. B sees A acting and acts. C sees A and B, acts. Exponential spread.

But cascades require visibility. Secret resistance doesn't cascade. Public resistance does. This is why revolutions need public squares, visible symbols, dramatic acts.

Cascade threshold formula:
If (Visible Supporters / Total Population) > Individual Threshold → Join

Most people's threshold: ~10-30%. Once 10% visibly support revolution, cascade becomes unstoppable. But getting to 10% is hard when early supporters face maximum punishment.

## Violence Gradient

Revolutionary violence follows gradients:

1. **Symbolic violence** (statue toppling)
2. **Property violence** (building burning)
3. **Defensive violence** (fighting police)
4. **Offensive violence** (hunting enemies)
5. **Systematic violence** (organized terror)

Each level normalizes next level. Once you've burned buildings, killing defenders seems reasonable. Once you've killed defenders, hunting enemies seems logical.

The gradient is one-way. Societies that reach level 5 don't step back to level 2. They continue to exhaustion or counter-revolution.

## Thermidor Mechanics

Every revolution generates counter-revolution. Not from defeated enemies but from exhausted revolutionaries.

Thermidor pattern:
1. Revolutionary energy peaks
2. Extremists overreach
3. Moderate revolutionaries ally with moderate conservatives
4. Extremists eliminated
5. "Normal" returns (but transformed)

This isn't betrayal. It's exhaustion. Revolution is metabolically expensive. Society can't maintain revolutionary tempo indefinitely. Thermidor is return to sustainable metabolism.

## The New Normal

Post-revolution never returns to pre-revolution. The energy discharge transforms social landscape permanently.

Changes lock in:
- Power relations altered
- Property redistributed  
- Symbols replaced
- Language evolved
- Expectations shifted

Even restoration can't restore. The Bourbon Restoration kept most revolutionary changes. You can't unbake bread. You can't unflow energy. Revolution is irreversible reaction.

## Revolutionary Engineering

Understanding mechanics enables engineering:

**To accelerate revolution**:
- Increase pressure (inequality)
- Decrease resistance (legitimacy)
- Provide catalyst (triggering event)
- Build vanguard (organized core)

**To prevent revolution**:
- Release pressure (reforms)
- Increase legitimacy 
- Remove catalysts (stability)
- Co-opt vanguards (inclusion)

But engineering has limits. Complex systems resist control. Revolutionary mechanics describe probabilities, not certainties. The machine made of humans remains fundamentally unpredictable in specifics while predictable in patterns.
