# Market Day

## Core Insight
The ancient gathering where trade becomes ritual, social fabric, and information exchange.

Before malls and Amazon, market day was civilization's heartbeat. Farmers brought produce, craftsmen brought wares, everyone brought news. The market wasn't just economic - it was cultural DNA replication, where ideas spread faster than goods.

Watch a traditional market: haggling isn't conflict but dance. Both parties know the steps - opening high, countering low, meeting in middle. It's price discovery through social ritual, creating fairness through mutual struggle. The argument itself has value, establishing relationship and respect.

Markets create more than exchange - they create community. Regular interaction builds trust. Reputation becomes currency. The cheater is remembered and shunned. The fair dealer attracts repeat custom. Social capital accumulates alongside economic capital, often worth more.
