# Ecosystem Exchange

## Core Insight
Ecosystems are economies where currency is energy, nutrients, and information - showing how sustainable trade really works.

A forest is a vertical marketplace. Canopy trees trade shade for soil nutrients. Understory plants trade lower light tolerance for protection. Decomposers trade recycling services for steady food supply. Every niche is a business model, every species an entrepreneur.

Energy is the universal currency, flowing from sun through photosynthesis into complex food webs. But efficiency matters - only 10% transfers between trophic levels. Nature discovered lean operations billions of years before Toyota. Waste from one process becomes resource for another.

Ecosystem collapse teaches market dynamics. Remove keystone species (like wolves from Yellowstone) and whole system restructures. Trophic cascades are market crashes in slow motion. Reintroduction shows recovery - markets healing through diversity restoration. Resilience comes from redundant trade relationships.
