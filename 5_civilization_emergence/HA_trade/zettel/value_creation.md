# Value Creation

## Core Insight
Trade doesn't just move value - it creates value through contextual transformation.

Water in desert versus water in ocean - same molecule, different value. Trade moves resources from low-value to high-value contexts, creating wealth without creating matter. The merchant who carries spices from abundance to scarcity is a value creator, not just mover.

Combination creates exponential value. Alone, wheel is good. Alone, axle is useful. Together, they revolutionize transport. Trade enables combination - bringing together components that multiply each other's utility. Every innovation is essentially a new trade combination.

Information trade creates purest value. When I teach you something, I still have it. When you share an idea, it doubles. Unlike physical goods depleted by use, information goods grow through trade. The internet revealed value creation's true nature - abundance through sharing, not scarcity through hoarding.
