# Supply and Demand

## Core Insight
The invisible hand is actually a feedback loop, balancing want against availability through price signals.

Supply and demand isn't human invention - it's physics. Water flows from high pressure to low. Heat transfers from hot to cold. Goods flow from abundance to scarcity, with price as the pressure differential. Markets are thermodynamic systems seeking equilibrium.

Consider oxygen at sea level versus mountaintop. Abundant below, scarce above - creating pressure differential we call altitude sickness. Now imagine charging for air based on altitude. The market already exists in our biology, gasping for breath at 20,000 feet.

Digital goods broke traditional supply/demand. Copying costs nothing, supply is infinite, yet artificial scarcity maintains prices. But new dynamics emerge: attention becomes scarce resource. Time is finite supply. Network effects create demand feeding on itself. The invisible hand adapts to new physics.
