# Cosmic Marketplace

## Core Insight
The universe itself might be a vast marketplace where fundamental forces trade space for time, matter for energy, order for entropy.

Consider cosmic inflation as IPO - universe going public, rapidly expanding to create market liquidity. Dark energy as quantitative easing, continuously injecting space to prevent deflation. Galaxies as corporations, merging and acquiring through gravitational hostile takeovers. Black holes as market makers, providing liquidity by consuming everything.

The anthropic principle suggests we exist in universe with tradeable physics. Too few dimensions, no complex structures possible. Too many dimensions, no stable orbits. Our universe has precisely right physics for maximum trade complexity - suggesting selection effect. We observe this cosmos because only tradeable universes generate observers.

If multiverse exists, universes might trade between themselves. Quantum tunneling could be inter-universal arbitrage. Black holes might be trade portals. Big Bang could be acquisition of our universe by larger market. We exist inside transaction between cosmic traders operating at scales beyond comprehension.
