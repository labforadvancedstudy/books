# Financial Systems

## Core Insight
Money is humanity's attempt to create universal trade protocol - a meta-layer enabling all other exchanges.

Financial systems evolved to solve coordination problems. Barter doesn't scale - finding someone who has what you want and wants what you have (double coincidence) limits trade. Money breaks this constraint, creating abstract value storage and transfer medium. It's civilization's API.

But abstraction creates new problems. Derivatives trade on trades, options on futures on commodities. Financial instruments become recursive, self-referential. 2008 crisis was stack overflow error in global financial code. System complexity exceeds human comprehension - we debug crashes without understanding causes.

Cryptocurrency attempts system rewrite. Instead of trusting institutions, trust math. Instead of central control, distributed consensus. It's not just new money but new financial physics - programmable value following algorithmic laws. Smart contracts are trade agreements enforced by universe itself.
