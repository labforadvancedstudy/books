# Trade Topology

## Core Insight
Trade networks have inherent shapes that persist across scales - from neural networks to shipping routes to galaxy clusters.

Network topology determines trade possibilities. Hub-and-spoke creates efficiency but fragility. Mesh networks offer resilience but complexity. Small-world topology (local clusters with long-range connections) appears everywhere - brain structure, social networks, internet architecture. Evolution converges on optimal trade shapes.

Power laws govern network formation. Few nodes have many connections (hubs), many nodes have few connections. Amazon, Google, major ports dominate respective networks. This isn't accident but mathematical inevitability - preferential attachment creates rich-get-richer dynamics. Network topology is destiny.

Topological transitions mark phase changes. When connection density crosses threshold, isolated clusters suddenly merge into connected whole. Globalization was topological phase transition - local markets crystallizing into world system. Cryptocurrency enables new topology - every node potentially connected, no mandatory hubs.
