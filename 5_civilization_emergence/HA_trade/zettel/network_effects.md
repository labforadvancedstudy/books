# Network Effects

## Core Insight
Value grows exponentially with connections - each new node enriches all existing nodes.

Metcalfe's Law quantifies ancient wisdom: network value proportional to square of users. Two telephones enable one connection. Five enable ten. A thousand enable half million. But this understates reality - actual value often grows faster than quadratic as complexity enables emergence.

Biology mastered network effects first. Each new neuron doesn't just add processing power - it multiplicatively increases possible thought patterns. Each new species in ecosystem doesn't just add biomass - it creates new niches for others. Networks create possibility space.

Modern platforms are network effect machines. Each Facebook user makes platform valuable for all others. Each Uber driver improves service for all riders. Each Bitcoin user strengthens entire network. Winner-take-all dynamics emerge because network effects create unstoppable momentum - success feeds success.
