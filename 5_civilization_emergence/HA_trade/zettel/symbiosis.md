# Symbiosis

## Core Insight
Life discovered trade billions of years ago - different organisms exchanging resources for mutual survival.

Lichens exemplify primal trade: fungi provide structure and minerals, algae provide photosynthesized sugars. Neither could survive alone, together they colonize bare rock. This isn't cooperation by choice but trade by necessity - the original merger and acquisition.

Your gut microbiome represents a vast trading floor. Bacteria break down food you can't digest, receiving shelter and nutrients in return. You are not an individual but a trading consortium, a walking ecosystem of mutual exchange.

Coral reefs showcase trade networks rivaling any human city. Clownfish trade protection for anemone shelter. Cleaner fish trade parasite removal for food. Sharks trade hunting grounds for cleaner stations. The reef is a marketplace where currency is service, shelter, and survival.
