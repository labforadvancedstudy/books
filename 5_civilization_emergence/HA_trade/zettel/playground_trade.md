# Playground Trade

## Core Insight
Children's spontaneous exchanges reveal trade stripped of adult abstractions.

Watch children trade Pokemon cards, share snacks, or swap toys. They operate on pure desire and fairness intuition. "I'll give you my sandwich for your cookies" - no market analysis, no price discovery, just immediate value recognition.

Playground economics teaches us that value is contextual. A shiny rock becomes treasure, a stick becomes a sword worth trading cards for. Children naturally understand that trade creates joy on both sides - the excitement of getting something new often outweighs what's given up.

They also discover natural limits: the child who never shares finds themselves excluded from future trades. Reputation emerges organically. Trust builds through repeated fair exchanges. The playground is humanity's first market, teaching cooperation through self-interest.
