# Mutualism

## Core Insight
When trade benefits both parties, it becomes an evolutionary strategy that shapes entire ecosystems.

Flowers and pollinators created Earth's first advertising industry. Bright colors and sweet nectar are marketing expenses, paid to ensure pollen delivery service. The flower "pays" in advance with nectar, trusting the bee to complete delivery. This trust, encoded in DNA, predates human contracts by millions of years.

Mycorrhizal networks reveal underground mutualism. Fungi extend tree roots' reach by 1000x, trading minerals for photosynthesized sugars. Trees even use fungi networks to trade resources between species - birch feeding fir in shade, fir feeding birch in winter. The forest is a single trading organism.

Mutualism scales: cells traded independence for multicellular advantages. Organisms trade individual fitness for group survival. Humans trade personal autonomy for civilization's benefits. Each level of organization emerges from successful mutual trade relationships.
