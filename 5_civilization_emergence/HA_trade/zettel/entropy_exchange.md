# Entropy Exchange

## Core Insight
Life trades local entropy decrease for global entropy increase - the fundamental trade that enables existence.

Every living system is an entropy pump, creating internal order by exporting disorder to environment. You maintain body temperature by radiating heat. Cities concentrate organization by spreading waste. Civilization is elaborate entropy management system, trading chaos for temporary complexity.

Stars are entropy traders on cosmic scale. Fusion creates heavy elements (local order) while radiating heat (global disorder). Galaxies trade angular momentum through tidal interactions. Black holes are ultimate entropy sinks, trading everything for maximum disorder. Universe itself might be one vast entropy transaction.

Information and entropy are linked through thermodynamics. Maxwell's demon could trade information for work, violating second law. But acquiring information requires energy, preserving thermodynamics. Every computation, every thought, every trade increases universal entropy. Order is borrowed, not owned.
