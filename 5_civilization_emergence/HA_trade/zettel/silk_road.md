# Silk Road

## Core Insight
The first world wide web - a physical network that proved ideas travel faster than goods.

Silk Road was humanity's first internet, connecting nodes (cities) through protocols (trade agreements) to exchange packets (camel caravans). Like TCP/IP, it was fault-tolerant - when war blocked one route, traders found another. The network was the value, not any single path.

What flowed mattered less than the flow itself. Yes, silk went west and gold went east, but religions, languages, technologies, and diseases traveled both ways. The Silk Road was an information superhighway disguised as trade route. Marco Polo was a packet switched between civilizations.

The network created its own economy. Caravanserais (rest stops) became cities. Protection services became kingdoms. Translation became profession. The infrastructure of trade became more valuable than traded goods - pattern repeated with railroads, internet, every network since.
