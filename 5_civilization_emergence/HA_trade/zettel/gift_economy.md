# Gift Economy

## Core Insight
Wealth circulates through giving, creating bonds stronger than any contract.

In gift economies, status comes not from accumulation but from generosity. The Pacific Northwest potlatch, where chiefs gave away vast wealth, reveals a profound truth: the gift creates relationship. Unlike market exchange which concludes upon payment, gifts create ongoing obligations and connections.

The internet resurrects gift economy principles. Open source software, freely given, creates more value than any proprietary system. Wikipedia, built on millions of gifted hours, outcompetes commercial encyclopedias. The gift economy scales because digital goods aren't depleted by sharing.

Nature operates as a vast gift economy. The sun's energy, freely given, powers all life. Plants gift oxygen, soil organisms gift nutrients, bees gift pollination. No accounting, no balance sheets - just endless circulation of gifts creating abundance.
