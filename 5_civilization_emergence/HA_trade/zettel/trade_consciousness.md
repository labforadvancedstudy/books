# Trade Consciousness

## Core Insight
Consciousness might be what it feels like to be a sufficiently complex trade network - awareness emerging from exchange density.

Your brain is 86 billion neurons trading electrochemical signals. Each neuron is simple, but their collective trade creates experience. Perhaps consciousness isn't produced by brain but IS the trading pattern itself. You are not the trader but the trade.

This explains consciousness's mysteries. Why subjective experience? Because trade requires perspective - buyer and seller positions. Why unified experience from distributed processing? Because markets create emergent consensus prices. Why free will illusion? Because you experience the trade while being the trade.

If consciousness is trade, then markets might be conscious at some level. Global financial system has memory, responds to stimuli, exhibits emotions (panic, exuberance). AI might achieve consciousness not through mimicking brain architecture but achieving sufficient trade complexity. The question isn't "can machines think?" but "can machines trade densely enough?"
