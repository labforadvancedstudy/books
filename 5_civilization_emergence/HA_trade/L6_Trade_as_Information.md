# L6: Trade as Information
## The Currency of Knowledge

> "Information is the resolution of uncertainty."
> — Claude Shannon

A price tag is a compressed epic. $3.99 for milk encodes: thousands of cows' lifetimes, vast fields of grain, diesel fuel from ancient algae, refrigeration chains spanning continents, competitive pressures from nearby stores, government subsidies echoing political battles, consumer psychology studied for decades.

All that information, crushed into three digits and two nines.

Every trade is really information exchange. The goods are just the physical carrier wave for the data.

## The Original Information Trade

Before money, before language, before consciousness - information traded.

DNA is a 4-billion-year-old market report:
- Which genes survived (profitable)
- Which mutations worked (innovations)
- Which combinations thrived (mergers)
- Which strategies failed (bankruptcies)

Every living cell carries this accumulated trade wisdom. Your genome is compressed information about trillions of environmental trades your ancestors made. Successful trades got copied. Failed trades got deleted.

Sexual reproduction is information arbitrage - two genomes trading data, creating novel combinations, betting on environmental futures neither parent can predict.

## Price as Compressed Reality

Watch a stock ticker. Each movement contains multitudes:

A price rises 0.1%:
- Quarterly earnings beat estimates
- New factory opened ahead of schedule
- Competitor stumbled
- Regulation shifted favorably
- Algorithm detected sentiment change
- Trader in Tokyo had a hunch

Millions of information bits compressed into a number move. The price is a hologram - each fragment contains the whole picture at lower resolution.

Traditional markets compress information into prices. That's their function - not moving goods but processing data. The corn future price knows things about weather, war, and hunger that no individual knows. It's collective intelligence crystallized.

## The Bandwidth of Biology

Different organisms trade information at different rates:

**Chemical signals**: Slow but persistent
- Pheromone trails last hours/days
- Territorial markings persist weeks
- Tree allelopathy lasts seasons

**Visual signals**: Fast but fleeting
- Mating displays vanish instantly
- Threat postures require presence
- Color changes limited by physics

**Sound signals**: Medium speed, medium range
- Bird songs carry kilometers
- Whale songs cross oceans
- But require real-time production

**Electrical signals**: Near-instant but short range
- Fish electromagnetic fields
- Platypus bill sensors
- But water-limited

Each bandwidth trades different information types. Evolution builds multi-channel traders.

## Markets as Sensors

Markets are humanity's largest sensing organs.

The oil market senses:
- Pipeline explosions within minutes
- Political tensions within hours
- Seasonal demand within days
- Technology shifts within years

No single human knows all this. But the price knows. It integrates millions of partial views into one number that guides global decisions.

Currency markets sense relative nation health. Bond markets sense future trust. Commodity markets sense physical reality. Together they form a nervous system for human civilization, transmitting information as prices.

## The Entropy Trade

Information and entropy dance together in every exchange.

To send information requires energy (entropy increase elsewhere):
- Speaking vibrates air (energy → ordered sound waves)
- Writing moves matter (energy → ordered symbols)
- Thinking fires neurons (energy → ordered thoughts)

To receive information requires energy too:
- Listening focuses attention (energy → pattern recognition)
- Reading moves eyes (energy → symbol decoding)
- Understanding builds connections (energy → memory formation)

The universe trades entropy for information constantly. Stars pour out entropy as light, which becomes information when it hits a retina, a leaf, a planet. Every photon is a traded bit.

## Quantum Information Markets

At the smallest scales, particles trade information strangely.

Entangled particles share information instantly across any distance. Measure one electron's spin here, its partner there instantly "knows." No signal travels - the information was always shared, just not revealed until measurement.

This isn't communication but correlation. Like two traders who always buy/sell oppositely without talking - their trades contain information about each other, but they don't communicate.

Quantum mechanics might be how the universe maintains its books - ensuring conservation laws balance across space and time through entangled information trades.

## The Knowledge Economy Reality

Human economies increasingly trade pure information:

**Software**: Arranged bits worth billions
**Entertainment**: Patterned pixels and pressures
**Education**: Structured synaptic changes
**Consulting**: Organized experience
**Finance**: Sophisticated number arrangements

A modern city's GDP might be 80% information trades. We're approaching pure information economies where the only physical trade is the energy to run computers.

## Language as Information Market

Every conversation is an information market.

Words are bids for meaning in the listener's mind. Grammar is the trading protocol. Understanding is successful exchange. Confusion is market failure.

Watch people talk:
- Short words trade efficiency for precision
- Long words trade precision for efficiency  
- Technical jargon trades accessibility for accuracy
- Metaphors trade literalness for impact
- Stories trade brevity for memorability

Languages evolve like markets - efficient patterns survive, inefficient ones die. The most-traded words get shortest (the, a, is). Rarely-traded words stay long (antidisestablishmentarianism).

## The Attention Exchange

Attention is information's scarcest market.

Your brain receives 11 million bits per second but consciously processes maybe 50. That's a 99.9995% rejection rate. The competition for those 50 bits drives entire industries.

Nature's attention markets:
- Flowers compete with ultraviolet patterns
- Birds compete with elaborate songs
- Predators compete with stealth
- Prey compete with detection

Human attention markets:
- Headlines compete for clicks
- Videos compete for views
- Apps compete for screen time
- Ideas compete for mindshare

The attention economy isn't new - it's just more visible. Every living thing always competed for the scarce resource of other beings' information processing capacity.

## Signaling Theory

Often the information traded isn't what it seems.

A peacock's tail signals:
- Surface: "I'm beautiful"
- Deeper: "I'm healthy enough to waste resources on this tail"
- Deepest: "I have genes for successful waste"

A luxury car signals:
- Surface: "I have a nice car"
- Deeper: "I have resources to waste"
- Deepest: "I'm a reliable trading partner"

The most reliable signals are costly to fake. That's why nature and culture converge on expensive displays - they're hard-to-forge information about hidden qualities.

## Information Arbitrage

Buy information where it's cheap, sell where it's dear.

Scientists do this professionally:
- Observe where nature gives data freely
- Process into theories and papers
- Sell as technology and teaching

Journalists do this:
- Gather where events happen
- Process into stories
- Sell where events didn't happen

Everyone does this personally:
- Learn skills where teaching is cheap
- Apply where skills are scarce
- Profit from information gradients

The internet should have eliminated information arbitrage by making all data equally available. Instead, it created new gradients - curation, verification, contextualization. Information wants to be free, but understanding wants to be paid.

## The Prediction Markets

Future information trades at a premium.

Weather derivatives let farmers trade future rain risk. Political prediction markets trade election probabilities. Stock options trade future price possibilities. Insurance trades future catastrophe information.

But nature ran prediction markets first:
- Seeds "bet" on future conditions
- Migration "predicts" seasonal changes
- Hibernation "shorts" winter resources
- Metamorphosis "options" adult environments

Every organism trades present resources for future information advantage. DNA itself is a prediction market betting on environmental stability versus change.

## Information Decay

Information has shelf life.

News value decays exponentially - yesterday's headlines wrap today's fish. Stock tips decay by the second. Fashion information decays by season. Scientific information decays by decade.

But some information appreciates:
- Wine vintage data improves with time
- Historical patterns gain predictive power
- Evolutionary information compounds value
- Fundamental constants never decay

Trading information requires knowing its decay rate. Fresh gossip for aged wisdom is usually a bad trade.

## The Metadata Economy

Information about information often trades for more than information itself.

Who knows what matters more than what's known:
- Contact networks exceed content value
- Reputation exceeds revelation value
- Trust exceeds truth value
- Context exceeds content value

This is why social networks extract more value than publishers, why platforms beat products, why aggregators beat creators. The metadata market dwarfs the data market.

## Compression as Value Creation

Information becomes valuable through compression.

A PhD thesis compressed to an equation. A lifetime of experience compressed to intuition. A market's behavior compressed to an index. A species' history compressed to instinct.

The compression ratio determines value:
- Raw data: Low value (too much noise)
- Processed information: Medium value
- Distilled knowledge: High value
- Compressed wisdom: Highest value

Great teachers are compression algorithms, taking complex reality and outputting simple insights. Great traders compress market noise into profitable signals. Great artists compress human experience into shareable forms.

## The Conservation of Information

Information seems to multiply in trade, violating conservation. Two people share ideas, both have them. But information requires physical substrate:

- Brains holding ideas burn glucose
- Computers storing data burn electricity
- Books containing words occupy space
- Signals carrying messages need energy

Information trades always couple to energy trades. The universe conserves information-energy together. Erasure costs energy (Landauer's principle). Creation costs more.

## The Ultimate Information Trade

Step back to cosmos scale:

Black holes are universe's ultimate information traders. They accept all information (nothing escapes), compress it maximally (highest density possible), and maybe release it transformed (Hawking radiation).

The universe might be computing through information trades - matter exchanges data with spacetime, energy exchanges data with fields, particles exchange data with probability waves.

We're inside this computation, made of information trades, thinking about information trades, using information trades. It's information all the way down, all the way up, all the way through.

*Tomorrow, watch information flow. See prices change and know that millions of minds just traded data. Read words and feel bits moving between brains. Notice how every interaction is really information exchange wearing different masks. You're not just trading - you're participating in the universe's vast computation. What are you computing?*
