# Imperial Bureaucracy

## Core Insight
Power through paperwork - transforming domination into administration.

Bureaucracy is empire's nervous system. It converts the emperor's will into millions of small actions: taxes collected, roads maintained, rebels registered. The Chinese mandarins, Ottoman viziers, British civil servants - they made empire work day by day.

The brilliance of imperial bureaucracy: it depersonalizes power. A farmer doesn't rebel against the tax collector; he complies with Form 1040-EZ. Domination becomes procedure. Violence becomes violation of subsection 3.2.1. The bureau chief doesn't oppress; he processes.

But bureaucracy also constrains empire. Rules accumulate like sediment. Procedures become more real than purposes. The Qing dynasty choked on its own examinations. The Spanish empire drowned in legal appeals from the colonies. The machine designed to project power becomes powerful itself.
