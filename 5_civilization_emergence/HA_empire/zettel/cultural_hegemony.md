# Cultural Hegemony

## Core Insight
When the conquered learn to love their chains - empire's greatest magic trick.

Cultural hegemony is conquest of the mind. It's when Roman subjects start thinking in Latin, when colonized peoples dream of Oxford, when everyone measures success by the empire's standards. Harder than taking land, but more permanent than any fortress.

The mechanism is insidious: imperial culture becomes synonymous with civilization itself. Local languages become "dialects," indigenous knowledge becomes "folklore," traditional governance becomes "primitive custom." The empire doesn't need to enforce its ways when subjects enforce them on each other.

Gramsci saw it clearly: the most stable domination is consensual. When provincial elites send their children to imperial schools, when local artists imitate metropolitan styles, when success means becoming more like the colonizer - that's hegemony. The empire rules not through fear but through aspiration.
