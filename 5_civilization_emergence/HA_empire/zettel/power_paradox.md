# Power Paradox

## Core Insight
Absolute power is absolutely self-defeating - empire's fundamental contradiction.

Power corrupts not morally but structurally. The more power concentrates, the less it can see. The more control extends, the less it controls. Empire achieves maximum power at the moment it begins losing it. Victory contains defeat like an egg contains a bird.

Consider: emperors surrounded by truth-distorting courtiers, governors ruling through information they can't verify, generals commanding armies they can't directly observe. Each layer of power adds a layer of distortion. Perfect hierarchy creates perfect ignorance at the top. The eye atop the pyramid is blind.

But deeper: power changes reality around itself, making accurate perception impossible. The emperor's presence transforms every interaction. True conditions hide behind performance. The most powerful person in empire knows least about empire. Omnipotence creates impotence. The paradox isn't solvable - it's structural.
