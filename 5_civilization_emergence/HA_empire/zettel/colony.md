# Colony

## Core Insight
A piece of the metropole planted in foreign soil - empire's cellular reproduction.

Colonies are empire's children, born of violence and raised in exploitation. Unlike simple conquest, colonization implants the conqueror's society into the conquered land. Settlers arrive, languages change, new cities rise with familiar architecture.

The genius and horror of colonies: they become self-sustaining organs of extraction. British India administered itself while sending wealth to London. Spanish America created entire castes to manage indigenous labor. The colony learns to oppress itself on the empire's behalf.

But colonies are unstable by design. They're neither fully of the empire nor separate from it. This liminal status creates perpetual tension - loyal enough to obey, distinct enough to exploit. Every empire's map is dotted with these pressure points, each one a potential site of rupture.
