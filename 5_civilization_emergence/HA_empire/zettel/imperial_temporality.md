# Imperial Temporality

## Core Insight
Empire bends time itself - past, present, and future become imperial constructs.

Empires don't just control space; they colonize time. Imperial history becomes world history. Roman dates mark "civilization's" calendar. British museums hold humanity's past. The colonized exist in imperial time - "discovered" when conquered, "modernized" when exploited.

The temporal trick: empire positions itself as history's culmination and future's guardian. Everything before was leading to this moment of imperial glory. Everything after depends on imperial continuity. The Qing were the Mandate of Heaven realized. The British were evolution's apex. Time itself seems to flow through imperial channels.

But this temporal dominance fractures. Colonial subjects live in multiple times - imperial clock time, indigenous seasonal time, revolutionary future time. The empire proclaims eternal rule while showing obvious decay. Yesterday's "barbarians" become tomorrow's conquerors. Time, that most imperial subject, eventually rebels.
