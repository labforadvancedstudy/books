# Empire as Organism

## Core Insight
Empire isn't built; it grows, feeds, reproduces, and dies like a living thing.

Viewing empire as organism reveals patterns invisible to political analysis. Birth through conquest-mitosis. Growth by digesting territories. Circulation systems moving resources from extremities to heart. Immune systems fighting rebellion-infections. Reproduction through colonies. Aging through institutional sclerosis. Death by organ failure.

The organic metaphor explains empire's paradoxes. Why can't empires stop expanding? Same reason tumors can't stop growing - it's their nature. Why do empires eventually collapse? Same reason organisms die - entropy accumulation, system breakdown, inability to adapt. The life cycle isn't a choice; it's an emergent property.

But unlike biological organisms, empires are conscious of their mortality. Roman writers obsessed over decline while still ascending. This self-awareness creates feedback loops - fear of death accelerating policies that hasten it. The organism that knows it's dying dies differently.
