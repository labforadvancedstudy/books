# Imperial Knowledge

## Core Insight
Empire knows in order to rule - knowledge itself becomes imperial.

Empires are knowledge machines. They map territories, census populations, classify subjects, codify laws. The British Survey of India wasn't neutral science - it was operational intelligence. Knowing becomes a form of owning. The map precedes the territory it claims to describe.

This knowledge reshapes reality. Colonial categories become ethnic identities. Administrative boundaries become national borders. Imperial languages become thought itself. The colonized eventually can't imagine themselves outside imperial frameworks. Even resistance uses imperial categories.

But imperial knowledge has blind spots by design. It sees what serves power, ignores what doesn't. Legible subjects, illegible souls. Countable resources, uncountable relationships. Mappable territories, unmappable meanings. The empire knows everything except why it will fail. Omniscience with perfect scotomas.
