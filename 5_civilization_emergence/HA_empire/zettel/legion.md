# Legion

## Core Insight
Professional violence, perfectly organized - the iron fist of empire.

The Roman legion epitomizes imperial military power: 5,000 men moving as one organism. Not warriors seeking personal glory, but professionals executing systematic violence. Dig ditches, build roads, crucify rebels - all in a day's work.

Legions were empire-building machines. Self-sufficient units that could march anywhere, build their own fortifications, and hold territory indefinitely. They turned war from heroic chaos into industrial process. Discipline over courage, logistics over valor.

Every empire has its legions - the Mongol tumens, British redcoats, American carrier groups. Professional armies that project power across vast distances. They're not defending homes; they're extending borders. The legion makes empire possible by making resistance futile.
