# Conquest

## Core Insight
Taking by force what was never given - the primal act of empire building.

Conquest is the violent acquisition of territory, resources, and people. It's the muscle movement of empire - armies marching, cities falling, borders redrawn. The conqueror arrives with superior force and declares: "This is mine now."

But conquest is more than physical occupation. It's the moment when one society's will is imposed on another. The conquered don't just lose land; they lose the right to say no.

Every empire begins with conquest. Rome took Italy, then the Mediterranean. The Mongols swept across Asia. Spain claimed the Americas. The pattern repeats: superior military technology meets weaker resistance, and maps change color.
