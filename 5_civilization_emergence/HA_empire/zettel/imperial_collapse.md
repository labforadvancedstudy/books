# Imperial Collapse

## Core Insight
Empires don't fall - they complexify to death.

Collapse isn't conquest by barbarians or rebellion by subjects. It's complexity exceeding capacity. Each problem solved creates new problems. Each reform adds administrative layers. Each crisis demands exceptional measures that become permanent. The empire doesn't break; it seizes up like an overengineered machine.

Tainter showed it mathematically: diminishing returns on societal complexity. Rome's later emperors worked harder than Augustus for worse results. The Qing's final reforms accelerated their fall. Solutions become problems become bigger solutions become catastrophic problems. The doom loop of increasing complexity.

But collapse reveals something profound: empires are dissipative structures, maintaining order by increasing universal entropy. When energy inputs can't match complexity costs, the system simplifies violently. What took centuries to build vanishes in decades. The intricate becomes primitive overnight. Civilization's Jenga tower falls.
