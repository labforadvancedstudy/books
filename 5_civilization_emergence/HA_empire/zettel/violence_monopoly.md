# Violence Monopoly

## Core Insight
Empire is the privatization of violence into a single corporation.

Weber defined the state as monopolizing legitimate violence. Empire takes this further - it monopolizes violence across multiple societies. Local warriors become bandits. Traditional authorities become rebels. Only imperial force remains legal. The sword becomes a government franchise.

This monopoly transforms society. Instead of many small violences, one vast violence. Instead of local strongmen, distant bureaucrats. The total amount of violence may decrease, but its organization becomes total. Pax Romana meant Roman peace - enforced by Roman swords exclusively.

The monopoly creates strange dependencies. Subjects lose the ability to defend themselves, must rely on imperial protection. When empire weakens, chaos returns doubled - not just the old violence, but new ones born from the power vacuum. The medicine becomes the disease. Order and chaos become imperial properties.
