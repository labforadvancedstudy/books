# Economic Imperialism

## Core Insight
When guns become graphs and colonies become markets - empire in a business suit.

Economic imperialism conquered more thoroughly than armies ever could. No flags need planting when debt does the work. No governors need appointing when corporate boards rule. The World Bank and IMF achieved what the British Navy couldn't - voluntary submission to metropolitan control.

The mechanism is elegant: loans create dependency, structural adjustment enforces policy, market access becomes the new tribute. Argentina doesn't send gold galleons to Spain anymore; it sends interest payments to New York. The periphery still feeds the center, but through credit ratings rather than colonial governors.

Yet this empire denies being one. It speaks of partnership, development, free markets - never domination. The absence of visible force makes resistance harder. How do you rebel against a spreadsheet? How do you declare independence from a credit score? The softest empire proves the hardest.
