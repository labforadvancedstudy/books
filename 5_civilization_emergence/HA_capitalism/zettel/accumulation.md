# Accumulation

## Core Insight
The compulsive drive to transform profit into more capital, creating an ever-expanding spiral of production and destruction - capitalism's prime directive that overrides all human needs.

Accumulate, accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets! Capital cannot rest, cannot enjoy, cannot be satisfied. Every profit must become new investment, every return must be reinvested.

Why? Because standing still means death in a competitive market. The capitalist who consumes their profit rather than reinvesting will be destroyed by those who accumulate.

This creates absurdities:
- Destroying food while people starve (to maintain prices)
- Empty homes while people are homeless (awaiting appreciation)
- Planned obsolescence (to ensure continued accumulation)
- Endless growth on a finite planet

The machine cannot stop. We are all servants of accumulation.
