# Capital as Subject

## Core Insight
The terrifying realization that capital has become the true subject of history, with humans reduced to its objects - we don't use it, it uses us.

In philosophy, the "subject" is what acts, what has agency. Supposedly that's us, humans. But under capitalism, capital acts:
- It moves across borders
- It decides what gets produced
- It allocates resources
- It shapes laws
- It starts wars
- It determines who lives and dies

We become its instruments. The capitalist is capital personified. The worker is variable capital. The consumer is realization of value. We are moments in capital's self-expansion.

The AI we fear already exists - it's called capital, and it's been running the show for centuries.
