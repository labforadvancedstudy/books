# Competition

## Core Insight
The war of all against all that capitalism makes necessary - not human nature but systemic compulsion that turns potential collaborators into inevitable enemies.

Competition under capitalism is not a choice but a commandment: compete or die. The baker who refuses to undercut rivals won't stay a baker long. The worker who won't outperform colleagues won't stay employed.

This forced battle creates a race to the bottom:
- Lower wages (to cut costs)
- Longer hours (to produce more)
- Environmental destruction (externalize costs)
- Planned obsolescence (force repeat purchases)

The tragedy: we have the technology for abundance but competition enforces scarcity. We could all win but the system demands losers.
