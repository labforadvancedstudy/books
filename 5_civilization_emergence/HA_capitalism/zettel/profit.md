# Profit

## Core Insight
The difference between what something costs to produce and what it sells for - the alpha and omega of capitalist motivation.

Profit is not just "extra money." It's the commandment that drives the entire system: Thou shalt make more than you spend, or perish.

Where does profit come from? Not from cheating (though that helps). Not from working harder (machines don't sweat). It comes from paying workers less than the value they create. The gap between wages paid and value produced: that's profit.

The iron law: without profit, capital dies. With profit, it must grow. There is no steady state.
