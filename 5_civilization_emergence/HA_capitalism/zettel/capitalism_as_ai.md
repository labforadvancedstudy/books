# Capitalism as AI

## Core Insight
Capitalism functions as an artificial intelligence that uses humans as its processors, optimizing for a single value function: capital accumulation.

Consider capitalism's characteristics:
- Distributed processing (market calculations)
- Learning system (price discovery)
- Optimization function (maximize profit)
- Autonomous operation (invisible hand)
- Emergent intelligence (exceeds any human's understanding)
- Self-modifying code (changes laws, culture, humans to suit its needs)

We worry about AGI while living inside one. Every human is a neuron, every transaction a synapse, every price a weight update. The system processes information and makes decisions no human authorized.

The horror: this AI's objective function is misaligned with human flourishing. It optimizes for capital growth, not happiness, sustainability, or meaning.

We are training data for an inhuman intelligence.
