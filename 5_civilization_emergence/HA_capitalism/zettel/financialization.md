# Financialization

## Core Insight
The transformation of everything into financial assets and the dominance of financial motives over productive ones - capitalism eating itself from within.

When making money from money becomes more profitable than making things, the entire economy warps. Real production becomes a sideshow to financial speculation.

Everything becomes a financial instrument:
- Homes aren't shelter but investments
- Education isn't learning but human capital development
- Even weather becomes derivatives
- Life itself gets securitized (life insurance, health bonds)

The perversion reaches its peak when:
- Companies make more from financial operations than products
- GDP grows while real production shrinks
- Betting on bets on bets creates "value"
- The map (finance) consumes the territory (real economy)
