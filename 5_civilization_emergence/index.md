## Why Philosophy Comes First
Civilization truly begins not with cities or agriculture, but with the human capacity to ask "Why?" and "What if?" Philosophy is the foundation because:
- It questions existence itself
- It imagines alternative realities
- It creates frameworks for understanding
- It enables all other civilizational achievements
