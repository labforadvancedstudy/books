# Efficiency Worship

## Core Insight
The Dyson sphere represents humanity's transformation into a religion of optimization, where waste becomes sin and efficiency becomes virtue.

Every photon that escapes uncaptured is failure. Every orbit sub-optimal is blasphemy. The builder-cultures develop ethics based on thermodynamics: goodness equals minimal entropy increase, evil equals unnecessary waste. They judge civilizations by their Kardashev rating like we judge by moral principles.

This isn't wrong, just alien. When you command stellar power, efficiency determines how many minds can exist, how many experiences are possible, how long until heat death. Waste doesn't just squander resources - it squanders potential lives. The efficiency-worshippers see themselves as midwives to trillion-trillion future beings.

But something is lost. Beauty that serves no purpose. Art that converts no energy. Love that optimizes nothing. The sphere-builders become magnificent and sterile, powerful and joyless. They win the universe and lose their souls.
