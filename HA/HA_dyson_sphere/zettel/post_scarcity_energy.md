# Post-Scarcity Energy

## Core Insight
When energy becomes effectively infinite, the entire logic of civilization inverts. Competition becomes cooperation. Hoarding becomes sharing. Economics becomes aesthetics.

At 1% Dyson completion, we have more power than all human history combined. At 10%, we could simulate Earth's entire biosphere in perfect detail. At 50%, energy poverty isn't just solved - it's inconceivable. The question shifts from "can we afford?" to "what's the point?"

This breaks minds trained in scarcity. Politicians argue about energy distribution while engineers point out there's more than anyone could use. Wars over resources seem quaint when you could give each faction their own planet's worth of power. The last human conflicts are over meaning, not matter.

Post-scarcity energy means post-scarcity everything. With enough power, you transmute elements, create antimatter, fold space. The only remaining scarcity is purpose.
