# Solar Panels in Space

## Core Insight
The journey to a Dyson sphere begins with a single solar panel floating in vacuum, converting starlight to electricity with no atmosphere to dim it.

On Earth, solar panels fight through miles of air, clouds, and night. Even in the Sahara, they capture maybe 20% of the sun's local intensity. In space? Nothing between photon and panel. 24/7 illumination if positioned right. Five times the energy per square meter. This isn't improvement - it's a paradigm shift.

The first space solar power station above Mars changes everything. Not because of the power it provides (a mere gigawatt) but because of what it proves: we can build power infrastructure independent of any world. Energy becomes something you construct, not something you find.
