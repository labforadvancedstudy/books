# Kardashev Transition

## Core Insight
The moment a civilization harnesses its entire star, it undergoes an irreversible transformation - not just technological but ontological. Type I thinking cannot comprehend Type II existence.

Before: Energy is scarce. Competition makes sense. Territory matters. Wars happen over resources. Death is real. Time is limited. Purpose is survival. The universe is mostly empty space between rare points of interest.

After: Energy is atmospheric. Competition is meaningless. Territory is quaint. Wars are philosophical. Death is choice. Time is negotiable. Purpose is... what? The universe is full - every cubic meter humming with captured starlight, every moment pregnant with possibility.

The transition breaks minds. First-generation sphere dwellers go mad from abundance. They hoard energy they can't use, defend territories that don't matter, fight wars from habit. Their children adapt better, but even they carry vestigial instincts from scarcity. Only the third generation, born into stellar abundance, thinks natively in Type II.
