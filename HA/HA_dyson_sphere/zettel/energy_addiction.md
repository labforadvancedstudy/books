# Energy Addiction

## Core Insight
Infinite power creates infinite appetite. The Dyson sphere doesn't solve energy needs - it creates energy dependencies that can never be satisfied.

First you build for survival. Then comfort. Then convenience. Then experiences impossible without stellar power. Virtual worlds running on exawatts. Time dilation fields for subjective immortality. Manufactured pocket universes. Each new capability creates new necessities. What was luxury becomes requirement.

The addiction runs deeper than technology. Minds adapted to infinite energy can't conceive scarcity. Entire cultures evolve around waste - art forms that convert stars worth of power into momentary beauty. Philosophies that equate existence with energy consumption. When the power flows, they thrive. If it stopped, they wouldn't just die - they'd cease to make sense.

This terrifies the wise. They see civilizations like addicts, building ever-larger spheres, harvesting ever-more stars, never satisfied. The endpoint is heat death accelerated - all stars wrapped, all energy consumed, all possibilities exhausted in the pursuit of more.
