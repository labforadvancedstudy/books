# Stellar Responsibility

## Core Insight
When you harness a star, you become responsible for every world that orbits it. The builders of Dyson spheres inherit ethical obligations at astronomical scales.

Dimming the sun by even 1% changes every planet's climate. Earth cools. Mars freezes harder. Jupiter's storms weaken. The entire solar system's ecology - from bacterial mats to potential deep-ocean life - depends on stellar constants you're now varying. Do you have the right to edit nature at this scale?

The builders face impossible choices. Complete the sphere and freeze outer worlds. Limit construction and waste potential energy that could support quadrillions. Every decision creates winners and losers measured in biospheres. The ethics committees argue for millennia while construction proceeds.

Eventually, a cold logic emerges: existing life is finite, potential life is infinite. The sphere enables more life than it prevents. But the builders carry the weight - they become gardeners of stellar systems, responsible for every photon's path, every world's weather, every possibility foreclosed.
