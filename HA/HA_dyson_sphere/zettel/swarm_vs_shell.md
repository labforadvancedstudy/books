# Swarm vs Shell

## Core Insight
The popular image of a solid shell around the sun is gravitationally impossible. The real choice is between different flavors of orbital swarm, each with profound implications for what kind of civilization we become.

A Dyson swarm is really a dance. Millions of collectors in independent orbits, never colliding because orbital mechanics is predictable. Some orbit close for maximum intensity, others far out for stability. Each element is independent - if one fails, the others continue. It's robust, scalable, and forgiving.

A rigid shell fights physics every second. Gravitational forces try to collapse it. The sun's pressure tries to expand it. Any imbalance leads to catastrophe. But a shell creates interior space - a vast hollow where you control the environment completely. Different physics. Different possibilities.

The choice reveals values: swarm for pragmatists who value efficiency and safety, shell for dreamers who value new frontiers regardless of cost.
