# Energy Transmission

## Core Insight
Power is useless if you can't deliver it. The brutal physics of beaming energy across astronomical distances becomes the real challenge of stellar engineering.

Microwave beaming works but spreads. A beam tight enough to hit Mars from Earth orbit needs a transmitter array kilometers wide. Lasers stay focused better but require precise aim across distances where light-lag matters. Miss by a milliradian and you're heating empty space while cities go dark.

The early power satellites use relay stations - a daisy chain of collectors and retransmitters stepping energy across the solar system. Each relay loses 10% to conversion inefficiency. By the time power reaches the outer asteroids, half is gone. But half of effectively infinite is still effectively infinite.
