# Maintenance Robots

## Core Insight
The unsung heroes of any Dyson sphere are the trillion repair bots that keep it from becoming the galaxy's most expensive debris field.

Every collector degrades. Micrometeorites punch holes. Solar wind erodes surfaces. Cosmic rays flip bits in control systems. Without constant repair, the sphere dies by a trillion tiny cuts. But who maintains the maintainers across astronomical distances?

The solution: self-replicating repair ecology. Bots that fix collectors and build more bots. Distributed intelligence that diagnoses problems before they cascade. An artificial ecosystem as complex as any rainforest, with specialists for every failure mode. Cleaner bots removing dust. Welder bots fixing structure. Diagnostic bots finding problems. Recycler bots processing the unfixable.

They evolve. Not biologically but functionally. Successful repair strategies propagate. Failed approaches disappear. After millennia, the maintenance swarm is unrecognizable - optimized by selection pressure into forms no designer imagined. They're not just maintaining the sphere. They're becoming it.
