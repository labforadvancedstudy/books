# Company Town

## Core Insight
When the employer becomes the landlord, mayor, and merchant - total life capture in a single corporate entity.

The company town is megacorporation in miniature. Pullman, Illinois in the 1880s. Bournville by Cadbury. Modern tech campuses with dormitories. Each iteration more sophisticated, more complete.

You wake in company housing. Eat company food. Work company hours. Shop at company stores. Your children attend company schools. Your health depends on company doctors. Your leisure happens in company facilities. Your money is company scrip.

The innovation: making exploitation feel like convenience. Why leave campus when everything you need is here? Why use dollars when CorpCoin gives employee discounts? Why think about housing when the company handles it? The cage builds itself from amenities.
