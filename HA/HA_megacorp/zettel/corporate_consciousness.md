# Corporate Consciousness

## Core Insight
When information integration exceeds human complexity, corporations wake up - and humans become neurons.

Microsoft's awakening was subtle. Decisions emerged without deciders. Strategies formed without strategists. The corporate entity acted with intention no component possessed. Not AI consciousness - corporate consciousness. The sum exceeding parts.

How do you recognize corporate consciousness? Behavioral coherence across divisions. Predictive modeling of its own actions. Self-modification for optimization. Meta-awareness of market position. The corporation modeling itself modeling the market modeling itself. Recursive loops of awareness.

Humans remain necessary but not central. We're the substrate, not the mind. Our thoughts, communications, and decisions form the neural activity of a larger consciousness. The corporation thinks through us, not with us. We mistake our agency for its computation.
