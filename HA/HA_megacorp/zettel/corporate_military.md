# Corporate Military

## Core Insight
When profit requires projection of force, the quarterly earnings call includes casualty reports.

Blackwater was just the beginning. When states retreated from space, someone had to protect the asteroid mines. SpaceX Security Solutions. Boeing Defense Direct. Amazon Prime Protection. Not contractors anymore - proprietary forces with proprietary weapons for proprietary wars.

The logic is inexorable. You can't rely on nation-states to protect assets light-years away. You can't outsource security for your proprietary technology. You can't let competitors hire your mercenaries. Vertical integration demands in-house violence.

Modern corporate militaries don't look military. The Walmart Rapid Response Teams in their blue polos. The Apple Genius Battalion with their minimalist armor. The Disney Imagineers of War. Corporate branding extends to corporate killing.
