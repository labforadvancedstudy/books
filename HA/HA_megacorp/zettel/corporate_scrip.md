# Corporate Scrip

## Core Insight
Control the currency, control the citizen - from company store to closed-loop economy.

Amazon Coins were a game currency. Then employee benefits. Then accepted at Whole Foods. Then required for Prime services. When the dollar collapsed in 2089, people already had alternatives. Corporate currencies backed by corporate assets, accepted in corporate territories, managed by corporate algorithms.

The genius: making it convenient before making it mandatory. Employee discounts for using CorpCoin. Better exchange rates. Instant transactions. No government oversight. By the time fiat currencies fail, the infrastructure exists. The transition feels natural.

Each corporation mints its own, but exchange rates create hierarchies. ApplePay commands premiums. Walmart Wallet trades at volume. Tesla Token fluctuates with Musk's neural uploads. The forex market becomes inter-corporate power dynamics made visible.
