# Corporate Immortality

## Core Insight
Corporations achieve what humans cannot - functional immortality through modular replacement.

Humans die when critical systems fail. Corporations replace failed systems. The CEO dies? Promote the CFO. The workforce ages? Hire fresh graduates. Technology obsolesces? Acquire startups. The ship of Theseus with quarterly earnings.

But megacorp immortality transcends mere continuity. They backup themselves across star systems. Mirror corporations in parallel universes. Quantum-encrypted DNA in black hole vaults. Death becomes inconvenience, not conclusion. The corporation that cannot die cannot be stopped.

The price: human mortality becomes corporate resource. We live, breed, and die in corporate lifecycles. Our generations mark their quarters. Our innovations fuel their adaptation. Our deaths clear space for fresh components. Immortality built from mortality.
