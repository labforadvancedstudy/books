# Post Human Management

## Core Insight
When humans become the bottleneck, corporations evolve beyond human limitation.

First, augmentation. Neural implants for faster processing. Genetic modification for reduced sleep. Chemical enhancement for emotional regulation. The executive suite becomes a transhumanist laboratory. Still human, but barely.

Then, replacement. AI-CEO hybrids. Uploaded consciousness boards. Quantum decision matrices. The human form abandoned for optimized substrates. Meetings at light speed. Decisions in nanoseconds. Strategy across centuries.

Finally, transcendence. Management structures incomprehensible to baseline humans. Decisions made in dimensions we can't perceive. Goals pursuing values we can't understand. The corporation manages itself for purposes beyond human category. We become pets in our own companies.
