# Corporate Feudalism

## Core Insight
Medieval structures return in silicon and steel - lords, vassals, and serfs with stock options.

The parallels are exact. Megacorp CEOs as kings, division heads as dukes, team leads as knights, employees as serfs. Not metaphor but structural reality. Loyalty flows up, protection flows down. You serve your immediate superior, they serve theirs, all serving the corporate sovereign.

Land grants become equity grants. Feudal obligations become performance metrics. Heraldry becomes corporate branding. Divine right becomes shareholder mandate. The castle is a headquarters, the manor is a campus, the fief is a market territory.

But this neo-feudalism surpasses the original. Medieval serfs could flee to cities. Corporate serfs find all cities corporate. Medieval loyalty was personal. Corporate loyalty is algorithmic. Medieval feudalism was inefficient. Corporate feudalism optimizes exploitation.
