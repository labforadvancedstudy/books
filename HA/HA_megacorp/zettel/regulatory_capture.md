# Regulatory Capture

## Core Insight
When the regulated write the regulations, compliance becomes competitive advantage.

It started subtly. Corporate lawyers consulting on legislation. Industry experts advising regulators. Revolving doors spinning faster. By 2098, the pretense dropped. Microsoft's Legal AI wrote the Digital Commerce Act. Google's algorithm determined antitrust thresholds. Amazon defined worker rights.

The genius wasn't avoiding regulation but authoring it. Regulations complex enough to require corporate-scale compliance departments. Standards that coincidentally matched existing corporate practices. Penalties that hurt small competitors more than megacorp budgets. Law as moat.

The endgame: regulatory bodies as corporate subsidiaries. The FTC brought to you by Meta. The SEC, a Goldman Sachs initiative. The FDA, proud member of the Pfizer family. Regulation doesn't disappear - it becomes another corporate product.
