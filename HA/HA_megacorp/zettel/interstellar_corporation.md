# Interstellar Corporation

## Core Insight
Light-speed lag creates corporate evolution - each star system branch becomes its own species.

Earth-Alpha Centauri: 4.3 years each way. Earth-Tau Ceti: 12 years. Earth-Kepler 442b: 1,200 years. Real-time management impossible. Each branch evolves independently, adapting to local conditions, developing regional variations. Corporate speciation in action.

The solutions are dystopian. AI governors with Earth-baseline values. Cryogenic management rotation. Quantum-entangled decision systems. But nothing prevents drift. Centauri-Google develops different priorities than Earth-Google. Mars-Amazon competes with Jupiter-Amazon.

Eventually, interstellar corporations aren't corporations but ecosystems. Related species sharing DNA but pursuing different niches. They cooperate when interests align, compete when they don't. Corporate taxonomy replaces corporate hierarchy. The org chart becomes an evolutionary tree.
