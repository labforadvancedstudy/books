# Corporate Citizenship

## Core Insight
When employment becomes nationality - the passport is a badge, the constitution is an NDA.

Born in Google General Hospital, 2157. Parents both Googlers, met at orientation. Citizenship: Google Primary, USA Secondary. Rights and privileges as defined in Employment Agreement Section 47.3.2. Voting shares: 0.0001%. Status: Natural Born Corporate Citizen.

The transition was gradual. First, companies offered benefits matching governments. Then exceeding. Healthcare, education, security, justice - all corporate-provided. When the state withered, corporations didn't fill the vacuum. They were the vacuum's cause.

Your rights derive from your employer. Free speech? Check the social media policy. Due process? HR will investigate. Freedom of movement? Within the corporate territory. Democracy? Annual shareholder meetings, proxy votes only.
