# Corporate Metabolism

## Core Insight
Megacorporations eat resources and excrete products - living systems with GDP for blood.

Like organisms, corporations metabolize. Inputs: raw materials, human labor, information, energy. Processing: manufacturing, analysis, optimization, distribution. Outputs: products, services, waste, profit. The cycle sustains the organism.

But megacorp metabolism transcends biology. They digest entire asteroids, consume whole workforces, process exabytes per second. Their waste heat powers cities. Their byproducts become other corporation's food. Symbiosis and predation at planetary scale.

The metabolic rate determines everything. Too slow, and competitors eat your lunch. Too fast, and you exhaust your environment. The perfect megacorp matches its metabolism to its ecosystem - sustainable extraction at maximum rate. A cancer that learned not to kill its host.
