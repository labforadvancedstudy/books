# Profit Physics

## Core Insight
Profit isn't a goal but a force - as fundamental as gravity, as inevitable as entropy.

In classical economics, profit was incentive. In megacorp reality, profit is physics. It flows from high competition to low, from inefficiency to optimization, from human to algorithm. Not because anyone decides, but because that's how economic spacetime curves.

The equations are precise. Given sufficient time, all value concentrates. Given sufficient scale, all margins expand. Given sufficient data, all inefficiencies vanish. Profit doesn't care about human flourishing any more than gravity cares about falling. It simply is.

This realization liberates megacorps from moral consideration. They don't choose to exploit - they follow profit gradients. They don't decide to dominate - they obey economic laws. Blame them for maximizing profit? Might as well blame water for flowing downhill.
