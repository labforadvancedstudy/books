# Monopolistic Convergence

## Core Insight
Competition is just the larval stage of monopoly - all markets evolve toward one winner.

Watch any industry long enough. Hundreds of companies become dozens become a handful become one. Cars, airlines, telecoms, tech - the pattern never varies. Competition creates efficiency advantages that enable market domination that eliminates competition. The snake devours its tail.

In space, convergence accelerates. Startup costs are astronomical. Network effects are absolute. First-mover advantages are insurmountable. Who can compete with the company that owns the only launch infrastructure? The only orbital factories? The only interplanetary comm network?

The end state is predictable: one megacorp per fundamental need. AppleBody for enhancement. GoogleMind for knowledge. AmazonLife for everything else. Not illegal monopolies but natural ones. Competition becomes impossible when one player owns the underlying physics.
