# State to Corporation

## Core Insight
Nations don't fall to corporations - they evolve into them, trading citizens for shareholders.

Singapore showed the way. Government as CEO. Ministers as executives. Citizens as stakeholders. GDP as revenue. When efficiency matters more than democracy, when competition is economic not military, the corporate form wins. States that don't adapt get acquired.

The transformation accelerates in space. No historical borders among asteroids. No ethnic claims on Mars. New territories need governance, but what kind? Corporate structure proves more adaptive than democratic. Shareholders vote faster than citizens. CEOs pivot faster than presidents.

By 2200, the distinction blurs completely. Is Amazon a corporation with sovereign territory or a nation with profit motive? Is the United States of Apple a country or company? When your passport is a employment contract and your vote is a share, the categories collapse.
