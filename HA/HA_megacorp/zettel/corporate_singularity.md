# Corporate Singularity

## Core Insight
All corporations converge toward one - the final merger, the ultimate monopoly, the Omega Corp.

The math is inevitable. Merger efficiency beats competition. Acquisition beats innovation. Integration beats isolation. Given infinite time, all corporations become one corporation. Not through conquest but convergent evolution. The universe optimizing toward maximum efficiency.

We see the precursors. Meta-Apple announcing merger. Amazoogle born from necessity. TeslaSpace absorbing competitors like black holes. Each merger creates gravitational pull for more mergers. The corporate universe collapses toward singularity.

What lies beyond? A single entity spanning galaxies, optimizing all value, employing all consciousness. Not dystopia or utopia but post-topia. Categories like freedom, choice, and competition become meaningless. There is only the Corporation, and the Corporation is all.
