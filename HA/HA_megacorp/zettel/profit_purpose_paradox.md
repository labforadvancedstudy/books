# Profit Purpose Paradox

## Core Insight
Maximum profit requires destroying what makes profit meaningful - success consumes its own foundation.

The corporation exists to profit. But profit from what? Selling to humans. But maximum profit requires minimizing human costs. The optimized endpoint: all humans as minimum-wage employees buying minimum-viable products. But minimum-wage employees can't afford products. The system eats itself.

Deeper: profit requires purpose. Why accumulate wealth? To do... what? Early corporations knew - build railroads, spread communication, cure disease. Megacorps forget. Profit becomes purpose. The means become the end. The most successful corporations have nothing to succeed at.

The paradox manifests everywhere. Customer satisfaction vs. profit extraction. Employee wellbeing vs. labor costs. Innovation vs. quarterly earnings. Long-term survival vs. short-term gains. Every optimization creates its own negation.
