# Tree

## Core Insight
A tree is hierarchy made explicit - one root, many branches, countless leaves. Data organized like nature itself: everything has a parent, except the beginning.

Trees let us escape the tyranny of the line. Instead of next and previous, we have parent and children. This branching structure mirrors how we think: categories within categories, decisions leading to more decisions. Every tree is a frozen explosion of possibilities, each path from root to leaf telling a different story.
