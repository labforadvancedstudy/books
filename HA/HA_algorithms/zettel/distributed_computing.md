# Distributed Computing (L7)

## The Symphony of Machines

Distributed computing is the art of coordinating multiple computers to work together on a single problem. It's the technological embodiment of "many hands make light work" - but with all the complexity that collaboration entails.

## The Fundamental Challenge

How do we get independent machines to cooperate? This question spawns countless others:
- How do they communicate?
- What if some fail?
- How do we split the work?
- Who's in charge?

## Core Concepts

1. **Parallelism**: Multiple tasks at once
2. **Concurrency**: Managing simultaneous operations
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Surviving failures
4. **Scalability**: Growing with demand
5. **Consistency**: Keeping data synchronized

## The CAP Theorem

You can have at most two of:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data
- **Availability**: System remains operational
- **Partition Tolerance**: Survives network splits

This fundamental limit shapes all distributed systems.

## Real-World Examples

```python
# Simple map-reduce pattern
def map_reduce(data, map_func, reduce_func):
    # Map phase - distribute work
    mapped = []
    for chunk in partition(data):
        mapped.append(map_func(chunk))
    
    # Reduce phase - combine results
    result = mapped[0]
    for partial in mapped[1:]:
        result = reduce_func(result, partial)
    
    return result

# Distributed consensus (simplified Raft)
class Node:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.state = "follower"
        self.term = 0
        self.voted_for = None
        
    def request_vote(self, candidate_id, term):
        if term > self.term and self.voted_for is None:
            self.voted_for = candidate_id
            self.term = term
            return True
        return False
```

## Distributed Algorithms

1. **MapReduce**: Processing big data
2. **Paxos/Raft**: Achieving consensus
3. **Chord**: Distributed hash tables
4. **BitTorrent**: Peer-to-peer file sharing
5. **Blockchain**: Distributed ledgers

## The Philosophical Implications

Distributed computing mirrors fundamental questions about:
- **Society**: How do individuals coordinate?
- **Consciousness**: Is the mind distributed computation?
- **Reality**: Is the universe a distributed computer?
- **Knowledge**: How does collective intelligence emerge?

## Challenges at Scale

- **Network Latency**: Speed of light is finite
- **Partial Failures**: Some nodes die, others live
- **Clock Synchronization**: No universal "now"
- **Data Consistency**: Truth becomes relative
- **Security**: More attack surfaces

## Patterns and Anti-Patterns

Good patterns:
- **Idempotency**: Operations safe to retry
- **Event Sourcing**: Log everything
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fail fast and recover
- **Bulkheads**: Isolate failures

Anti-patterns:
- **Distributed Monolith**: Tight coupling
- **Chatty Services**: Too much communication
- **Distributed Transactions**: Often impossible
- **Assuming Reliability**: Networks always fail

## The Future of Computing

As we approach physical limits of single machines, distributed computing becomes not optional but essential. The future is:
- Quantum distributed systems
- Edge computing networks
- Brain-inspired architectures
- Interplanetary computing

## Life Lessons

Distributed computing teaches us:
- Communication is expensive
- Coordination is hard
- Failures are inevitable
- Simple solutions don't scale
- Perfect consistency is impossible
