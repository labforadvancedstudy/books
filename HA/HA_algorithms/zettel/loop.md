# Loop

## Core Insight
A loop is time made circular - do something, check if done, if not, do it again. It's how we turn "once" into "until."

Loops are everywhere: your heartbeat, the seasons, your daily routine. In algorithms, loops let us handle the unknown - we don't know how many times we'll need to repeat, but we know when to stop. The loop is our first victory over infinity.
