# Array

## Core Insight
An array is memory made linear - a row of boxes, each with a number on its door. Find any element instantly if you know its address.

Arrays are the most honest data structure: no tricks, no indirection, just contiguous memory laid bare. They trade flexibility for speed - you can't easily grow them, but you can leap to any element in constant time. It's the computational equivalent of apartment numbers: predictable, efficient, but rigid.
