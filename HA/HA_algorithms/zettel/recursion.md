# Recursion

## Core Insight
Recursion is a function looking in a mirror - it calls itself to solve smaller versions of the same problem. To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

Every recursive call is an act of faith: trust that the smaller problem will be solved, and use that solution to solve your own. It's delegation to your future self, a stack of promises waiting to be fulfilled. The base case is your anchor to reality - without it, you fall forever into the computational abyss.
