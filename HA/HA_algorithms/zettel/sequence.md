# sequence
*L1 â€¢ The River of Order*

A sequence is time made visible. It's the fundamental assumption that one thing follows another, that there is a "next."

## The Nature of Order

Sequences give us:
- **Direction**: From here to there
- **Position**: Where we are in the flow
- **Relationship**: What comes before, what comes after

## In Code

```python
# A sequence is a promise of order
sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Every sequence has a story
for i, element in enumerate(sequence):
    print(f"At time {i}, we have {element}")

# Sequences can generate themselves
def fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
```

## The Philosophical Weight

Sequences assume:
- Time has direction
- Order can be preserved
- Position has meaning
- The past determines the future

## The Paradox

Every sequence is both:
- A line through time
- A simultaneous whole
- A process unfolding
- A structure complete
