# Divide and Conquer

## Core Insight
Divide and conquer is problem-solving through decomposition - break the impossible into manageable pieces, solve each piece, then combine. It's how empires fall and algorithms excel.

This paradigm turns computational mountains into molehills. Can't sort a million items? Sort two groups of 500,000. Still too big? Keep dividing until you reach problems so small they solve themselves. The magic is in the merging - combining solved subproblems into a complete solution. It's recursion with purpose, turning exponential nightmares into logarithmic dreams.
