# Tournament Psychology
## Core Insight
Tournaments are psychological manipulation engines, creating pressure points, momentum swings, and narrative arcs that transform players into heroes or villains.

## Content
**Bracket Psychology**: Players study their path obsessively. "If I win here, I face them next." The draw itself affects performance - easy path breeds confidence, tough path creates pressure. Rivals placed to meet in finals create anticipation.

**Momentum Design**: Early rounds build confidence with weaker opponents. Difficulty escalates naturally. Rest periods prevent physical collapse but maintain mental pressure. The tournament becomes a psychological journey, not just physical competition.

**Pressure Points**: Elimination games create unique mental states. Must-win scenarios override normal thinking. Players check scoreboards constantly in group stages. Simultaneous final games prevent strategic manipulation but maximize anxiety.

**Narrative Creation**: 
- Group Stage: Characters introduced
- Round of 16: Stories emerge
- Quarterfinals: Heroes defined
- Semifinals: Destiny approaches
- Finals: Climax achieved

Tournaments don't find champions - they create them. The structure builds drama, pressure reveals character, and by the end, we have mythology. David vs. Goliath, redemption arcs, dynasty formation - all engineered by format.
