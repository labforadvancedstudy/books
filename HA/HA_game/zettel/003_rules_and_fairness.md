# Rules and Fairness
## Core Insight
Rules don't limit games - they create them. Without rules, there is no game, only chaos.

## Content
"That's not fair!" Every child knows this cry. It's the birth of justice, learned not in 
courts but on playgrounds. When we agree to rules, we create a temporary universe where 
everyone knows what's possible and what's not.

Rules are magical. They transform running into tag, hopping into hopscotch, throwing into 
darts. The same physical action becomes entirely different games just by changing the rules.

But here's the paradox: we *choose* to limit ourselves. We could move the chess knight 
anywhere, but we don't. We move it in an L-shape because that's what makes it chess. 
Constraints create creativity.
