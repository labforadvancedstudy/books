# Tournament Types
## Core Insight
Each tournament format creates different dynamics - single elimination maximizes drama, round robin ensures fairness, Swiss balances both, while hybrids seek optimal combinations.

## Content
**Single Elimination**: One loss and you're out. Brutal, fast, dramatic. Every game is life-or-death. Underdogs can miracle-run to victory. But one bad day destroys months of preparation. March Madness epitomizes this - 64 teams become 1 in three weeks of pure drama.

**Double Elimination**: Losers get a second chance through a parallel bracket. To win from the losers bracket, you must beat the champion twice. Fighting games love this - it allows comeback narratives while maintaining tension.

**Round Robin**: Everyone plays everyone. Most accurate determination of skill but time-intensive and often anticlimactic. European soccer leagues use this - every game matters equally, consistency rewarded over flash.

**Swiss System**: Players face opponents with similar records. No elimination but clear winners emerge. Chess standard - efficiently handles large fields while maintaining competitive balance.

**Hybrids**: Pool play into knockouts (World Cup), ladder systems (perpetual tournaments), or battle royales (100 to 1). Each seeks the perfect balance of fairness, excitement, and efficiency.

Format choice reveals priorities: Do we want the best team or the best story?
