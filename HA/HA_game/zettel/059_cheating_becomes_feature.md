# Cheating Becomes Feature
## Core Insight
Today's exploit is tomorrow's feature. Many beloved game mechanics began as unintended behaviors that players discovered and developers embraced.

## Content
Gaming history is littered with "cheats" that became core mechanics:

**Combos** in Street Fighter II were a bug - canceling one move into another wasn't intended. Players discovered it, mastered it, and now fighting games without combos feel incomplete.

**Rocket jumping** in Quake used explosion physics to gain height. Unintended, but so cool it became standard in shooters.

**Skiing** in Tribes exploited physics bugs to gain incredible speed. The developers embraced it, balancing the entire game around this "exploit."

**Wave dashing** in Smash Bros Melee uses animation canceling for advanced movement. Nintendo didn't intend it, but it defines competitive play.

Developer responses vary:
- Ban and patch (preserve original vision)
- Ignore if harmless (let players have fun)
- Embrace and balance (make it official)
- Build sequels around it (codify the accident)

This reveals a truth: the best games are collaborations between developers and players. Players will always push boundaries. The wise developer watches what emerges and asks: "Is this making the game better?"
