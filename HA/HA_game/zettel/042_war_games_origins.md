## Deep Insights

1. **War Games Reveal War's Structure**: Stripped of death, patterns emerge
2. **Conflict Is Human**: We must compete, better on boards than battlefields
3. **Abstraction Enables Empathy**: Enemy becomes opponent becomes friend
4. **Strategy Transcends Violence**: Intellectual combat satisfies
5. **Games Prevent Wars**: Maybe, through sublimation and understanding

## The Ultimate War Game

Perhaps civilization itself is the ultimate war game - competing cultures, economic warfare, soft power projection, influence operations. We're all playing, whether we know it or not. The question: Can we keep it a game?
