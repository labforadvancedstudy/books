# Playing Catch
## Core Insight
The simplest game: one object, two people, and the space between them creates infinite variation.

## Content
A ball arcs through the air. You reach out, fingers spread, and something magical happens - 
you *catch* it. Then you throw it back. That's it. That's the whole game.

But watch children discover catch for the first time. The ball drops, rolls away, bounces 
off their chest. They laugh. They try again. Something profound is happening here - they're 
learning the physics of the world through play.

Catch is primordial. Before language, before tools, our ancestors threw things. And when 
someone threw something back? The first game was born.
