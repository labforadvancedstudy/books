# Tournament Economics
## Core Insight
Modern tournaments are economic engines designed to maximize revenue through broadcast rights, sponsorship value, and attendance while maintaining competitive integrity.

## Content
**Broadcast Optimization**: Everything bends toward TV schedules. Finals on weekend prime time. Commercial breaks between sets/periods. Storyline development time between rounds. The tournament structure itself becomes a product, sold to networks before a single game is played.

**Sponsorship Architecture**:
- Title sponsors want their name on the trophy
- Round sponsors ("The Coca-Cola Quarterfinals")
- Official partnerships plastered everywhere
- Memorable moment association (replay sponsorship)

**Venue Economics**: Guaranteed minimum games keep facilities profitable. Double headers maximize ticket sales. Travel minimization for teams reduces costs. Geographic distribution spreads economic impact.

**The Attention Economy**: Tournaments compete for eyeballs. Format innovations (shot clocks, tiebreak systems) speed up action. Playoff expansion trades integrity for revenue. Wild card systems keep more teams "alive" longer, maintaining fan interest.

**Digital Revenue Streams**: Streaming rights fractured by region. Betting partnerships integrated into broadcasts. Fantasy tournaments parallel real ones. NFT moments from tournament highlights.

The modern tournament is less about finding champions and more about creating profitable entertainment products.
