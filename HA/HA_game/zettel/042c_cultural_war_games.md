## Western Approach: Individual Heroes

### Chess Tradition
- Powerful individual pieces (Queen, Knight)
- Focus on decisive battles
- Clear victory conditions
- Usually symmetric starts

The king matters. The queen dominates. Heroes win wars.

### American Evolution
- Risk: manifest destiny as game
- Stratego: hidden information warfare
- Axis & Allies: good vs evil clarity
- Diplomacy: betrayal normalized

Individualism extends to game design. One player can change everything.

## Eastern Philosophy: Collective Strategy

### Go/Weiqi Wisdom
- No individual pieces, all stones equal
- Gradual position building
- Influence over destruction
- Victory through balance

No heroes in Go. Only patterns, only space, only the collective position.

### Xiangqi (Chinese Chess)
- River divides the board
- Generals trapped in palaces
- Cannons jump to capture
- Advisors limited movement

Geography shapes strategy. The river cannot be ignored.

## Middle Eastern: Chance and Hidden Knowledge

### Backgammon Heritage
- Dice determine possibilities
- Chance in warfare acknowledged
- Bluffing and probability
- Racing and blocking

Allah's will through dice. Strategy submits to fate.

### Card-Based Conflicts
- Hidden information paramount
- Deception necessary
- Memory rewards
- Luck levels skill

Not all is known in war. The fog is part of the game.

## Nordic: Asymmetric Struggle

### Hnefatafl Legacy
- Defenders always outnumbered
- King must escape
- Different victory conditions per side
- David vs Goliath encoded

The raiders come. Can the king flee? History becomes mechanic.

## What Culture Reveals

Each culture's war games expose their beliefs about conflict:
- West: Heroes matter
- East: Position matters
- Middle East: Fate matters
- Nordic: Survival matters

We play war as we understand it. Our games reveal our souls.

## Modern Fusion

Globalization blends traditions:
- Western heroes in Eastern position games
- Chance elements in pure strategy
- Asymmetric balance everywhere
- Cultural exchange through play

The world's war games merge. Perhaps the world's wars will too - into games.
