# 043b_child_game_patterns.md - Universal Patterns in Child-Created Games

## The Four Archetypes

### Base/Safe Zone Games
- Universal concept of sanctuary
- "You can't tag me here!"
- Spatial rule creation
- Territory negotiation

Every culture independently invents the safe zone. Children need refuge from danger, even imaginary danger.

### Power Object Games  
- One item grants abilities
- "Whoever has the stick is king"
- Possession mechanics
- Transfer protocols

The crown, the conch, the ball - objects become power. Children understand authority through tokens.

### Transformation Games
- "If you touch the tree, you're frozen"
- State changes through action
- Rescue/revival mechanics
- Binary conditions (frozen/free, it/not-it)

Death and rebirth, endless. Children process mortality through reversible doom.

### Accumulation Games
- Collecting items/points/territories
- "First to ten wins"
- Victory conditions
- Counting systems

The first economy: gathering more than others. Competition quantified.

## Examples of Pure Creation

### The Floor is Lava
- Emerges worldwide without teaching
- Consistent rules develop independently
- Imagination creates shared reality
- Furniture becomes islands

### Invisible Touch Tag
- Pretending to throw invisible projectiles
- Hit = frozen/tagged
- Blocking mechanics develop
- Gesture-based proto-gaming

### Calvinball Variations
- Rules change during play
- Meta-gaming about gaming
- Creativity over consistency
- Chaos embraced as feature

### Hybrid Sports
- Soccer + basketball = new game
- Equipment creatively misused
- "Sockball," "Basketfoot"
- Innovation through combination

## The Genius of Simplicity

Best games need least:
- Stones and circles
- Sticks and dirt
- Bodies only
- Found objects

Complex games from simple elements. A ball creates infinite possibilities.
