# Lila: Divine Play
## Core Insight
In Hindu philosophy, Lila represents the universe as divine play - creation not from need but from joy, the cosmos as God amusing itself.

## Content
Lila (Sanskrit: लीला) offers a profound answer to why we play: because existence itself is play.

In this view:
- The universe is Brahman playing at being many
- Creation happens not from necessity but spontaneous joy
- All suffering is dramatic tension in the cosmic game
- Liberation (moksha) is remembering it's all play

This isn't mere metaphor. If consciousness is fundamental (as Vedanta suggests), then the universe is consciousness exploring itself through endless games. Every being is both player and played.

Western thought struggles with purposeless activity. If God is perfect, why create? Lila answers: for the joy of playing. No purpose needed beyond delight itself.

This explains play's paradoxes:
- Serious yet not serious (divine yet playful)
- Meaningful yet meaningless (important in the game, irrelevant outside)
- Voluntary yet compulsive (freely chosen but irresistible)

When we play, we echo the cosmic impulse that created everything.
