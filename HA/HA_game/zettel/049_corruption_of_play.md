# Corruption of Play
## Core Insight
Modern society corrupts play through professionalization, systematization, and commercialization. False play emerges when the spirit dies but forms remain.

## Content
Huizinga warned that true play was dying in modern times:

**Professionalization**: When playing becomes a job, it stops being play. Professional athletes are workers, not players. They can't quit when it stops being fun.

**Systematization**: Rigid leagues, rankings, and statistics drain spontaneity. Play becomes mechanical reproduction of optimized strategies.

**Commercialization**: When profit drives play, the play serves money rather than joy. Games become products, players become consumers.

**False play**: Propaganda disguised as games. Team-building exercises. Gamification of work. These wear play's mask but lack its spirit.

The corruption shows in language: we "play the stock market," "play politics," "play games" in relationships. These aren't play - they're manipulation wearing play's costume.

Real play resists corruption through its essential uselessness. The moment play serves external purposes, it begins to die.
