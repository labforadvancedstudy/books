# Cognitive Development and Games
## Core Insight
Games naturally match cognitive development stages. Children instinctively seek games that challenge their emerging abilities, creating a self-organizing curriculum of the mind.

Jean Piaget mapped how children's thinking evolves. Games follow this map perfectly:

**Sensorimotor (0-2 years)**: Peek-a-boo teaches object permanence. Dropping things teaches cause-effect. The game IS the learning.

**Preoperational (2-7 years)**: Pretend play explodes. A stick becomes anything. Rules are fluid, personal, changeable. "I'm the monster now!" Symbolic thinking through play.

**Concrete Operational (7-11 years)**: Rules become sacred. Board games with clear logic flourish. Fairness obsession emerges. Collections (cards, marbles) teach classification.

**Formal Operational (11+ years)**: Abstract strategy emerges. Chess, Go, complex card games. Hypothetical thinking: "If I do this, then they'll do that, so I should..."

Games don't just match development - they drive it. The child ready for harder games seeks them out. Too simple? Boring. Too complex? Frustrating. Just right? Flow state and growth.

This is why you can't force game progression. The six-year-old isn't ready for chess not because they lack intelligence, but because their brain hasn't built the necessary structures. Yet.
