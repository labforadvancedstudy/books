# Why We Play
## Core Insight
The ultimate mystery: not how we play or what we play, but why conscious beings waste precious survival time on purposeless activities. The answer might reveal the nature of consciousness itself.

## Content
After exploring games across all levels, we face the deepest question: Why do humans play?

Evolution ruthlessly eliminates waste. Every calorie matters. Yet every mammalian species plays, and the costlier the brain, the more elaborate the play. This suggests play isn't waste - it's essential. But essential for what?

The easy answers crumble under scrutiny:
- Practice theory? Adults play games that teach no survival skills
- Surplus energy? The poorest, most exhausted still choose play
- Social bonding? We play alone too
- Achievement? We play unwinnable games

Perhaps the question is wrong. Instead of "why do we play?" ask "why do we think we ever stop?" 

What if play isn't something consciousness does but something consciousness IS?
