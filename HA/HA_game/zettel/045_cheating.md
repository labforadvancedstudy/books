# Cheating
## Core Insight
Cheating is gaming's cardinal sin - not because it breaks rules, but because it breaks the deeper social contract that makes games possible.

## Content
Cheating fascinates because it's so hard to define. Rule-breaking? But some rule-breaking is encouraged (creative play). Unfair advantage? But games often have imbalances. Deception? But bluffing is often the point.

Cheating is ultimately about violating the spirit, not the letter. It's breaking the shared fiction that we're all playing by the same constraints. The cheater pretends to play while secretly operating by different rules.

This makes cheating worse than not playing. The spoilsport who refuses to play at least maintains honesty. The cheater corrupts the game from within while pretending allegiance to it.

Yet cheating reveals profound truths: where players cheat shows where games fail. What tempts cheating exposes what players truly want. How communities respond reveals their deepest values.

Cheating is gaming's shadow - dark, inevitable, and instructive.
