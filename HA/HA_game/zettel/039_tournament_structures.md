# Tournament Structures
## Core Insight
Tournaments are games about games - structured systems for determining superiority across multiple contests that reveal deep truths about fairness, drama, and values.

## Content
A tournament transforms isolated games into connected narrative. Single contests become chapters in a larger story with beginning (qualifying), middle (progression), and end (championship).

This meta-game layer creates meaning beyond individual matches. A regular season loss is forgotten; a playoff loss is remembered forever. Same game, different context, transformed significance.

Tournaments face an essential tension: fairness vs. entertainment. The "most fair" tournament (everyone plays everyone multiple times) is often boring. The most exciting (single elimination) can crown a lucky champion.

Every tournament structure embodies values:
- Single elimination values drama over accuracy
- Round robin values consistency over excitement  
- Swiss system values efficiency over simplicity
- Double elimination values redemption narratives

The perfect tournament doesn't exist because perfection depends on purpose. Are we finding the best player? Creating entertainment? Building community? Generating revenue? Different goals demand different structures.

Ultimately, tournaments are story engines that transform competition into narrative.
