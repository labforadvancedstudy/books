# Cosmic Play
## Core Insight
Reality itself might be a game. Physical laws are rules, evolution is the metagame, consciousness is the player, and meaning is the score.

## Content
Quantum mechanics reveals randomness at reality's foundation - dice at the heart of matter. Evolution is an algorithmic game played with DNA. Galaxies form through gravitational play between matter and dark energy.

If the universe plays, perhaps we play because we're made in its image.

Ancient wisdom knew this. Hinduism's Lila describes the universe as divine play - Brahman amusing itself by pretending to be many. Greek gods played with human fates. Chinese philosophy sees reality as the play of opposites.

Modern physics echoes this:
- Observer effect: consciousness affects the game
- Quantum uncertainty: God does play dice
- Multiverse: infinite game sessions
- Entropy: the cosmic game timer

What if consciousness evolved to match the universe's fundamental playfulness? We play not because we choose to, but because reality itself is playful. Games aren't imitations of life - life imitates the cosmic game.

In this view, every game is a fractal piece of the universal game. When we play, we participate in the fundamental activity of existence itself.
