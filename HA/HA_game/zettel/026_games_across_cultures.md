## Core Concept

Every human culture plays games, but what they play reveals deep cultural values. Games are cultural DNA—encoding and transmitting worldviews through play.

## Key Insights

### 1. Universal Patterns
Certain game types appear everywhere:
- **Chase games**: Tag, hide-and-seek variants
- **Chance games**: Dice, lots, randomizers
- **Strategy games**: Board positioning, territory
- **Physical games**: Running, throwing, wrestling

### 2. Cultural Variations
Same patterns, different expressions:
- **Go (Asia)**: Patient territorial expansion
- **Chess (Europe/Persia)**: Hierarchical warfare
- **Mancala (Africa)**: Cyclical resource distribution
- **Patolli (Mesoamerica)**: Cosmic journey

### 3. Values Embedded in Rules
Games teach cultural priorities:
- American football: Territory through force
- Cricket: Patience and proper form
- Mahjong: Reading hidden information
- Capoeira: Combat disguised as dance

## The Colonization of Play

How games spread and transform:
- Trade routes carry games
- Conquerors impose their games
- Local variants resist and persist
- Hybrid forms emerge

## Modern Homogenization

Globalization affects games:
- Video games create shared culture
- Olympic sports standardize play
- Traditional games fade
- New universal languages emerge

## Connection to HA

The universality of play suggests something deeper than culture—perhaps games tap into the operating system of human consciousness itself.
