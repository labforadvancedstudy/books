# 029 Metagaming

**Level**: L7 - Meta-Strategic Layer
**Domain**: Game Theory, Strategic Thinking
**Tags**: #meta #strategy #evolution #emergence

## Core Concept

The "metagame" is the game above the game—strategies about strategies, patterns of play that emerge from community interaction, the evolution of optimal play beyond designer intention.

## Key Insights

### 1. Levels of Meta
Games create recursive strategic layers:
- **Level 0**: Playing by rules
- **Level 1**: Common strategies
- **Level 2**: Countering common strategies
- **Level 3**: Predicting counter-strategies
- **Level ∞**: Infinite recursive prediction

### 2. Metagame Evolution
How metas develop:
- Discovery phase: Players explore possibilities
- Optimization phase: Best strategies emerge
- Dominant phase: Meta crystallizes
- Disruption phase: Innovation breaks meta
- Cycle repeats

### 3. Examples Across Domains
Metagaming everywhere:
- **Chess**: Opening theory evolution
- **Poker**: Playing the player, not cards
- **Esports**: Patch cycles and meta shifts
- **Social**: Fashion, memes, cultural trends

## The Knowledge Problem

Metagaming creates paradoxes:
- If everyone knows optimal strategy, it's no longer optimal
- Predictability enables counter-prediction
- Meta-knowledge changes the game
- Nash equilibria are unstable with humans

## Metagaming Reality

Life has metagames:
- Stock market: Trading on trader psychology
- Dating: Signaling and counter-signaling
- Politics: Controlling the narrative
- Academia: Citation games and trends

## Connection to HA

Humans might be the only species that consistently plays meta-games—thinking about thinking about thinking.
