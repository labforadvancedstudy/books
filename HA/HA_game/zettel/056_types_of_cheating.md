# Types of Cheating
## Core Insight
Cheating manifests in forms as diverse as games themselves - from crude physical manipulation to sophisticated psychological warfare.

## Content
**Technical Cheating**: The digital age birthed new forms - hacking game code, exploiting unintended mechanics, using aimbots or wallhacks. Technology fights technology in an endless arms race.

**Social Cheating**: Collusion between supposed opponents, ghosting (dead players helping living ones), stream sniping, account sharing. These break the social isolation games assume.

**Physical Cheating**: Ancient as games themselves - sleight of hand with cards, weighted dice, performance drugs, equipment tampering. The body cheats what the mind cannot.

**Psychological Cheating**: The grey areas - intimidation, angle shooting (technically legal but unethical), rules lawyering, using outside information. These dance on the edge of acceptability.

The spectrum runs from creative play through exploitation to clear cheating. Where exactly cheating begins depends on community standards, competitive stakes, and shared expectations. One game's cheat is another's clever strategy.
