# Play as Meaning-Making
## Core Insight
Games are humanity's meaning generators - they create significance from nothing, teaching us the essential skill of finding purpose in a purposeless universe.

## Content
Consciousness faces an existential problem: awareness of meaninglessness. We know we'll die. We know the universe doesn't care. This knowledge should paralyze us.

Instead, we play games.

In chess, moving a wooden horse in an L-shape becomes the most important thing in the world. In Monopoly, paper money gains real emotional weight. Games create temporary universes where arbitrary things matter intensely.

This isn't escaping reality - it's practicing reality's most essential skill. Life requires us to create meaning where none exists objectively. Career, relationships, achievements - all are games we've agreed matter.

Games are meaning-manufacturing devices. They prove we can create purpose from pure decision. Every game session is a rehearsal for the grand game of pretending life matters. And in pretending, we make it true.

The ability to generate meaning from nothing might be consciousness's defining feature. Games are how we develop and maintain this ability.
