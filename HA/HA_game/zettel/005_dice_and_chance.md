# Dice and Chance
## Core Insight
Dice democratize games - when luck enters, anyone can win.

## Content
Bones. That's what the first dice were. Knucklebones from sheep, marked and thrown. For 
millennia, humans have been throwing objects to let chance decide.

Why do we love randomness in games? Because it's the great equalizer. A child can beat 
a grandmaster if the dice favor them. Experience helps, but can't guarantee victory.

Dice transform decision into destiny. "Should I attack?" becomes "The dice say yes." 
We've created a tiny oracle, a direct line to the universe's fundamental uncertainty.
