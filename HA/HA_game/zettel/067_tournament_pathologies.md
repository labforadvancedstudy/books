# Tournament Pathologies
## Core Insight
Tournament structures create perverse incentives where losing becomes strategic, cooperation corrupts competition, and the format meant to ensure fairness enables manipulation.

## Content
**Tanking**: Deliberately losing for better position. NBA teams tank for draft picks. Soccer teams lose to avoid stronger opponents. Pool play teams throw games to manipulate brackets. The tournament structure makes losing valuable.

**Collusion**: When competitors cooperate against the competition itself:
- Match fixing for betting profits
- Agreed outcomes to eliminate threats
- Prize splitting negotiations
- "You win this one, I'll win next"

**Burnout**: Tournaments demand unsustainable performance. Too many games exhaust players physically. Constant pressure breaks them mentally. Peak performance becomes impossible. The structure designed to find the best instead destroys them.

**Bracket Manipulation**: Teams calculate optimal paths. "Better to finish second in group than first." Strategic yellow cards to miss "easy" games. Resting stars once playoff position secured. Gaming the system becomes part of the game.

**Competitive Integrity Death Spiral**: Once manipulation starts, honest competition looks foolish. Everyone must cheat to keep up. Trust evaporates. Fans lose interest. The tournament consumes itself.

These aren't bugs - they're features. Any system with stakes creates incentives to subvert it.
