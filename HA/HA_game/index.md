# HA: Game
## From Knucklebones to the Edge of Digital

### The Journey Ahead

This book traces humanity's relationship with games from our earliest ancestors to the dawn of the digital age. We'll climb the ladder of abstraction from a child's first game of catch to the philosophical mysteries of why we play at all.

Games are older than civilization. Before we had writing, we had dice. Before we had agriculture, we had play. This isn't just recreation - it's how we learn to be human.

## How to Read This Book

Each level builds on the previous one. You can't understand the philosophy of games without first feeling the joy of catch. You can't grasp the magic circle without knowing what it's like to lose.

Start at Level 0. Trust the process. By the end, you'll never see games the same way again.

## A Note on Video Games

This book ends where video games begin. The story continues in **HA: Video Games**, where we explore how electricity and computation transformed play forever. But to understand where we're going, we must first understand where we've been.

## The Real Mystery

After all this analysis, the deepest question remains: Why does a species that needs to survive waste so much time playing? The answer might tell us what it means to be human.

Or maybe, just maybe, it reveals that we're all characters in someone else's game.
