# Pattern Language

## Core Insight
Patterns for creating patterns - Christopher Alexander's discovery that design solutions form vocabularies that can be combined like words into sentences.

Alexander noticed that good architectural solutions repeat across cultures: courtyards, alcoves, varied ceiling heights. These aren't arbitrary - they solve recurring human needs. He catalogued 253 patterns from cities to doorknobs, each connecting to others.

The profound insight: patterns aren't isolated but form languages. Just as words combine into infinite sentences, design patterns combine into infinite solutions. Software adopted this: design patterns became the vocabulary for speaking solutions.
