# Symmetry

## Core Insight
The invariance under transformation - what remains the same when everything changes reveals the deepest truths of reality.

Symmetry isn't just aesthetic; it's the universe revealing its conservation laws. Every symmetry corresponds to something that cannot be created or destroyed. Time symmetry gives us energy conservation. Space symmetry gives us momentum conservation. The beauty we see in symmetry is physics showing its hand.

Noether's theorem proved it: every continuous symmetry generates a conservation law. Pattern and physics unite.
