# Chaos Pattern

## Core Insight
Deterministic systems creating unpredictable patterns - where simple rules generate complexity so rich it appears random.

Chaos isn't randomness but deterministic unpredictability. The butterfly effect: tiny changes cascade into massive differences. Yet within chaos lie strange attractors - patterns that emerge from the turbulence. The Lorenz attractor's butterfly wings, the Mandelbrot set's infinite depth.

Chaos reveals a profound truth: pattern and unpredictability aren't opposites but dance partners. Weather systems, population dynamics, heartbeats - all balanced on the edge between order and chaos.
