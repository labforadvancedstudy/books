# Golden Ratio

## Core Insight
1.618... - the proportion that appears when growth maintains perfect balance, nature's favorite number hiding in plain sight.

Phi (φ) emerges from a simple question: what rectangle, when you remove a square, leaves a rectangle with the same proportions? The answer creates a ratio that appears everywhere: nautilus shells, flower petals, galaxy spirals, human faces.

Why this number? It represents optimal growth - each new generation sized perfectly relative to the previous. Not too fast (unstable), not too slow (inefficient), but just right. Mathematics discovering aesthetics.
