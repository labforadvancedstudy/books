# Meta-Pattern

## Core Insight
Patterns about patterns - the recursive recognition that pattern-finding itself follows patterns.

The ultimate strange loop: we use patterns to find patterns. Our pattern recognition has patterns. These meta-patterns reveal the deep structure of knowledge itself:
- Abstraction patterns (how we generalize)
- Connection patterns (how we relate)
- Hierarchy patterns (how we organize)
- Transformation patterns (how we change)

Studying meta-patterns is like consciousness becoming aware of its own mechanisms. It's pattern recognition recognizing itself.
