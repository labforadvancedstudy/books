# Rhythm

## Core Insight
Pattern in time - the heartbeat of existence that turns duration into structure.

Rhythm is how time becomes tangible. Without rhythm, time would be a featureless flow. With rhythm, time gains texture: day/night, seasons, heartbeats, breath. Every living thing is a collection of rhythms nested within rhythms.

Rhythm creates expectation. After three beats, we anticipate the fourth. This anticipation is the birth of prediction, planning, consciousness itself. We are rhythmic beings in a rhythmic universe.
