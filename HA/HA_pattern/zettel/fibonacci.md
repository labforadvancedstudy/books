# Fibonacci

## Core Insight
The sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two - nature's favorite growth pattern hidden in pure mathematics.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... Simple addition rule creating profound pattern. The ratio between consecutive numbers approaches the golden ratio (1.618...). This isn't coincidence but necessity - optimal growth follows Fibonacci.

Why everywhere? Sunflower seeds, pine cone spirals, nautilus shells, galaxy arms - all Fibonacci. It's how nature packs maximum into minimum, how growth maintains proportion, how the simple becomes beautiful through repetition.
