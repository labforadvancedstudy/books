# Fractal

## Core Insight
Self-similarity across scales - the same pattern repeating at every level of magnification, revealing infinity in the finite.

Fractals shattered our intuition about dimension. A coastline isn't one-dimensional or two-dimensional but somewhere in between - 1.2, 1.5, 1.7 dimensions. Nature doesn't build with straight lines and smooth curves but with rough, self-similar structures that pack infinite complexity into finite space.

From blood vessels to river networks, from clouds to galaxies, fractals are how nature maximizes surface area, optimizes distribution, and creates robustness through redundancy.
