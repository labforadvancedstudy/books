# Pattern Recognition

## Core Insight
The fundamental cognitive ability to extract signal from noise - how mind meets pattern and meaning emerges.

Pattern recognition isn't just something brains do; it's what brains ARE. Every neuron is a pattern detector, firing when its specific input pattern appears. Stack millions of these detectors and you get vision, language, thought itself.

But here's the twist: we don't just recognize patterns, we impose them. We see faces in clouds, hear voices in static, find meaning in randomness. Pattern recognition is creative - we partially create what we recognize.
