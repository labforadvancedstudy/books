# Revolutionary Consciousness

## Core Insight
The phase transition in collective mind - when "the way things are" becomes "the way things were" before bodies move.

Consciousness shifts before action. Revolutionary consciousness is specific mental state: simultaneous awareness of current system's arbitrariness and alternative's possibility. Not just knowing things are bad, but knowing they need not be. The shift from complaint to revolution happens in consciousness first.

It spreads like virus but isn't external - it activates latent potential. Every oppressed person carries revolutionary consciousness seed; specific conditions trigger germination. Once activated, it's irreversible. You cannot unknow system's arbitrariness. Even if revolution fails, consciousness remains, waiting.

The markers: humor changes (sacred becomes mockable), language shifts (new words for old realities), time perception alters (future becomes present urgency). Revolutionary consciousness is reality reorganizing itself in minds before manifesting in streets. The violence is just consciousness becoming material.
