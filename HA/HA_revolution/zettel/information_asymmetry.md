# Information Asymmetry

## Core Insight
Revolution is information cascade - the moment when hidden knowledge becomes common knowledge and reality reorganizes.

Information asymmetry maintains regimes. Citizens believe others support regime, so conform despite private dissent. Regime believes citizens support it, so continues oppressing. Everyone performs loyalty while harboring rebellion. The asymmetry creates false stability - theatrical society.

Revolution's trigger: information symmetry event. Someone shouts "emperor has no clothes." Suddenly everyone realizes everyone knows. The cascade is instant - not changing minds but revealing existing consensus. Tunisia: one immolation revealed universal frustration. The information was always there, just asymmetrically distributed.

Digital age amplifies: social media makes private dissent visible, breaking asymmetry faster. Authoritarian response - internet shutdowns - admits the physics. They're not controlling information but trying to maintain asymmetry. Once symmetry achieved, revolution becomes coordination problem, not persuasion problem.
