# Power as Information

## Core Insight
Power doesn't flow through force but through information channels - revolution is system's information architecture failing.

Power is not substance but pattern - information pattern organizing human energy. King has no physical power; his power is information ("I am king") propagating through minds, organizing behavior. Power exists only in information space, manifests in physical space.

Revolution occurs when information pattern breaks. The message "obey the king" stops propagating. Not blocked actively - just loses credibility, stops being copied mind to mind. New pattern ("reject the king") propagates better, organizes behavior differently. The revolution already happened in information space; violence just syncs physical reality.

This explains modern power's fragility. Industrial power (factories, armies) was robust - physical destruction required. Information power (brands, platforms, currencies) is fragile - one scandal, hack, or narrative shift causes instant collapse. Power has dematerialized, become pure information. Revolutions now happen at thought speed.
