# Violence Eruption

## Core Insight
The moment stored social energy converts to kinetic force - revolution's phase transition made flesh.

Violence in revolution is not moral failure but physics. When pressure exceeds container strength, explosion is inevitable. The first stone thrown, the first window broken - these are not decisions but precipitations, like the first raindrop from a supersaturated cloud.

Revolutionary violence has a specific signature: it targets symbols before people. Statues fall, palaces burn, but initially bodies are spared. This reveals violence as communication - stored energy seeking to rewrite the social contract through destruction of old symbols.

The violence accelerates non-linearly. First incident triggers second, second triggers four, four triggers sixteen. Cascade mathematics. Each act lowers the activation energy for the next. What required courage initially becomes inevitable finally.
