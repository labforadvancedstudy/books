# Pattern Across Scales

## Core Insight
Revolutionary dynamics are scale-invariant - same pattern from office politics to civilizational collapse.

The pattern fractals perfectly. Office coup: workers unite against abusive manager, pressure builds, crisis triggers action, manager replaced, brief honeymoon, new manager gradually becomes abusive. Nation revolution: citizens unite against regime, pressure builds, crisis triggers action, regime replaced, brief honeymoon, new regime gradually becomes oppressive.

Scale changes, pattern doesn't. Family (parent-child rebellion), company (startup disrupting incumbent), ecosystem (new species displacing old), stellar (supernova redistributing matter). The universe computes revolution algorithm at every scale. It's not metaphor - it's same mathematics.

This reveals revolution as fundamental force like gravity. Not human invention but universal principle. Any system capable of accumulating gradients will eventually release them catastrophically. Revolution is how universe prevents permanent inequality. Even galaxies revolt - black holes eventually evaporate, returning their mass to cosmos.
