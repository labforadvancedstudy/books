# Metastable States

## Core Insight
Pre-revolutionary societies exist in false equilibrium - stable until perturbed, then catastrophic collapse to true ground state.

Metastability is physics of delayed inevitability. Diamond is metastable carbon - should be graphite but transition requires activation energy. Pre-revolutionary societies are metastable - should have already collapsed but persist through inertia. Small perturbation can trigger cascade to ground state.

The signs: increasing brittleness. Metastable systems handle small shocks poorly. Minor protests become major crises. Routine corruption becomes regime-threatening scandal. The system overreacts because it unconsciously knows its instability. Repression increases not from strength but from fear.

Most fascinating: everyone knows but pretends not to. Citizens perform loyalty while planning escape. Officials enforce laws while stealing state assets. The whole society becomes theater, maintaining form while substance evaporates. Metastable states are zombies - dead but still walking until someone notices.
