# Energy Redistribution

## Core Insight
Revolution's function: violently redistributing social energy from excessive gradient to sustainable flow.

Revolution is not politics but physics - a system resetting unsustainable energy distribution. Like earthquake releasing tectonic pressure, revolution releases social pressure. The violence is proportional to accumulated gradient: deeper inequality = more violent redistribution.

The pattern is consistent: revolution begins by destroying energy sinks (palaces, banks, tax offices) and creating energy sources (land redistribution, debt cancellation, wealth seizure). This is not ideology but mechanics - the system seeking new equilibrium.

Fascinating: revolution cannot create energy, only redistribute. Post-revolutionary societies often poorer in absolute terms but more equal in relative terms. The total energy (wealth) decreases through violence, but flow improves. Like controlled forest fire - destruction enabling regeneration.
