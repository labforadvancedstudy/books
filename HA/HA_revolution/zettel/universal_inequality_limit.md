# Universal Inequality Limit

## Core Insight
Every complex system has maximum sustainable inequality - beyond this limit, revolution is not possibility but certainty.

The limit is mathematical, not moral. Like maximum slope before avalanche, maximum pressure before explosion, maximum inequality exists before revolution. The value varies by society (culture, technology, resources) but limit's existence is universal. No society has ever sustained Gini coefficient above 0.85.

Why universal? Because humans are physical objects with needs. When inequality prevents need satisfaction for critical mass, physics overrides politics. Starving humans will risk death for food - not choice but thermodynamics. The limit is where social structure's binding energy equals potential energy of desperation.

The limit is rising. Technology enables higher inequality: surveillance suppresses organization, propaganda manufactures consent, automation reduces elite's need for masses. But physics remains: even perfect control cannot violate conservation laws. The energy accumulates until it finds release - if not through revolution, then through collapse.
