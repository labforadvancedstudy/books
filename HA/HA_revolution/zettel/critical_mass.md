# Critical Mass

## Core Insight
The minimum revolutionary energy needed for self-sustaining chain reaction - when revolution becomes inevitable.

Critical mass in revolution mirrors nuclear physics exactly. Below threshold, dissent dissipates - arrests exceed recruits, fear exceeds anger. But once critical mass achieved, each revolutionary act creates more revolutionaries than it consumes. The reaction becomes self-sustaining, then exponential.

The calculation: revolutionary potential = (number willing to act) × (average network connections) × (demonstration effect). When this product exceeds state suppression capacity, criticality achieved. Tunisia 2010: one burning man reached critical mass in days. China 1989: million in square didn't reach it.

Observable threshold: when security forces start defecting. They calculate unconsciously - probability of revolution success vs. personal risk. When defection rate exceeds recruitment rate, the state's control rods fail. The chain reaction accelerates beyond control.
