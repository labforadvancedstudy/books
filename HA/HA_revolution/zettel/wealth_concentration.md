# Wealth Concentration

## Core Insight
Money pools like water in gravity wells - but unlike water, concentrated money warps the space around it to attract more.

Wealth concentration isn't policy failure but physics. Money is energy, and energy systems naturally evolve toward maximum entropy gradients. The rich getting richer isn't greed - it's thermodynamics. Capital attracts capital like mass attracts mass, curving economic spacetime.

The pattern is universal: 80/20 becomes 90/10 becomes 95/5. Pareto was observing gravity. But here's the revolution key: every system has a critical concentration limit. When 1% controls 50%, system remains stable. When 1% controls 90%, potential energy of the 99% exceeds system binding energy.

Measure this: Gini coefficient is revolution's thermometer. Above 0.6, social temperature rises. Above 0.7, phase transition begins. Above 0.8, explosion inevitable. You can suppress symptoms (police, propaganda) but you cannot violate physics. The energy will find release.
