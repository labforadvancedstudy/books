# Social Thermodynamics

## Core Insight
Society obeys thermodynamic laws - energy conservation, entropy increase, heat death unless external energy added.

First law in society: wealth/energy is neither created nor destroyed, only transformed. Revolution doesn't create prosperity, it redistributes existing wealth. Post-revolutionary societies often discover less total wealth than expected - energy lost to friction (violence, chaos, destruction).

Second law in society: entropy (disorder) always increases. Every organization decays, every hierarchy corrupts, every revolution ages into regime. Fighting entropy requires constant energy input. Revolutions reset entropy temporarily but cannot reverse its direction.

Third law in society: perfect equality (absolute zero) is impossible. Even most egalitarian societies develop micro-hierarchies, tiny inequalities. As social temperature approaches zero (perfect equality), change rate approaches zero. Frozen societies are dead societies.

These laws explain revolution's necessity and futility. Necessary: to reset unsustainable entropy. Futile: entropy always returns. The cycle is not bug but feature - society's heartbeat.
