# Crowd Gathering

## Core Insight
Physical bodies accumulating in space - the most primitive observable of revolutionary energy concentration.

When social energy reaches critical levels, it manifests as physical gathering. Like iron filings to a magnet, bodies are drawn to centers of revolutionary potential. The crowd is not just people - it's accumulated frustration made visible, potential energy seeking kinetic release.

The density matters. Sparse gatherings dissipate. But when crowd density exceeds a threshold - when you can feel the heat of other bodies, when individual space collapses - the crowd becomes a single organism. This is observable physics: temperature rises, movement synchronizes, individual decision-making dissolves into collective will.

Revolutionary crowds have a specific quality - they gather despite risk, not for celebration. The energy cost of gathering (lost wages, police threat, social stigma) is overcome by stored frustration. When gathering happens despite high cost, revolution is near.
