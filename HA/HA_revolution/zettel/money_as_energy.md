# Money as Energy

## Core Insight
Money isn't wealth symbol - it's literally social energy, obeying conservation laws and thermodynamics.

Money = energy is not metaphor but physics. Money enables work (economic definition = physics definition). It flows from high concentration to low, but only through conductors (markets, wages, taxes). It converts between forms (capital→labor→goods→capital) with efficiency losses. It cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.

Revolutionary insight: energy systems have maximum sustainable gradients. In electronics, excessive voltage difference arcs across gaps. In society, excessive wealth difference arcs as revolution. The arc is not malfunction - it's physics correcting unsustainable gradient.

This explains why revolutions correlate with wealth gaps, not absolute poverty. Peasants with nothing don't revolt - no potential energy. Middle class falling while watching rich rise creates maximum gradient. The energy differential, not absolute levels, determines revolutionary potential.
