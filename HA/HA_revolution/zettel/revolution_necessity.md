# Revolution Necessity

## Core Insight
Revolution is not political choice but thermodynamic necessity - civilization's only alternative to heat death.

Without revolution, what? Permanent stratification. Entropy maximizes locally (within classes) while system-wide flow stops. Medieval Japan: thousand-year stasis. Caste systems: frozen hierarchies. These aren't stable but dead - civilizations that stopped breathing.

Revolution is civilization's heartbeat, pumping energy from accumulated pools back into circulation. Remove heart, body dies. Remove revolution, society necrotizes - extremities (poor) die first, infection spreads upward, eventually even brain (elite) rots. Revolution isn't disease but immune response.

The necessity is mathematical. Given: humans accumulate advantage. Given: advantage compounds. Given: resources finite. Therefore: revolution or death. No third option exists in physics. Political systems just determine revolution's frequency and violence, not its necessity. The only choice is managed pressure release or catastrophic explosion.
