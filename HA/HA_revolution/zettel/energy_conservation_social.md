# Energy Conservation Social

## Core Insight
Social energy is absolutely conserved - revolution transforms but cannot create human potential.

The conservation law holds perfectly: sum of all human energy (labor, creativity, loyalty, resistance) remains constant. Revolution only redirects flow. Energy spent supporting regime becomes energy overthrowing it. Energy maintaining hierarchy becomes energy destroying it. Total unchanged.

This explains post-revolutionary disappointment. Revolutionaries imagine untapped energy reserves - genius peasants, suppressed innovation, hidden wealth. But revolution reveals truth: same humans, same limitations, just different arrangement. The king's palace becomes people's museum, but someone still must clean it.

Deeper: emotional energy conserves too. Love for leader becomes hate for tyrant - same intensity, inverted direction. Hope for reform becomes rage for revolution - same magnitude, different vector. Revolution is not creating new feelings but rotating existing ones. The conservation extends to meaning itself.
