# Human Nature Inequality

## Core Insight
Humans are inequality-generating machines - revolution exists because equality is unstable equilibrium in human phase space.

Start with perfect equality. Within moments: someone works harder, thinks clearer, coordinates better. Microscopic advantages compound. The talented attract resources, resources enable greater talent expression, feedback loop engaged. Inequality isn't imposed but emerges from human variation interacting with time.

This is not moral judgment but physics. Humans vary (genetics, environment, luck). Variation plus time equals inequality. Like gas molecules in gravity - start evenly distributed, end stratified by weight. Human society stratifies by competence, connections, capital. Natural as water finding level.

Revolution doesn't solve this - it resets it. Post-revolutionary equality immediately begins degrading. New inequalities emerge, often mirroring old patterns (revolutionary leaders become new elite). Revolution is not cure for inequality but treatment for its terminal stage. Humans will always need revolution because humans will always generate inequality.
