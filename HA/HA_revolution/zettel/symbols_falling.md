# Symbols Falling

## Core Insight
Physical destruction of meaning-containers - the necessary erasure before new reality can be written.

Statues topple with mathematical precision. The crowd calculates unconsciously: rope length, angle of pull, center of gravity. But they're not just destroying bronze - they're killing gods. Each falling symbol is reality admitting it was always fiction.

The selection is never random. Crowds destroy symbols in order of energy extraction. The tax office burns before the post office. The palace falls before the museum. Revolutionary violence is an audit of suffering, conducted in fire.

Most profound: the moment a symbol falls, reality reorganizes. The statue's absence changes the square more than its presence ever did. People walk differently, speak differently, see differently. The physical act of destruction is surgery on collective consciousness - removing the tumor of imposed meaning.
