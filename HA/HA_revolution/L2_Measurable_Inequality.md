# L2: Measurable Inequality
## Counting the Pressure

In 1788, a French peasant kept 20% of what they produced. The rest went to nobles, church, king. By 1789, they kept 15%. That 5% difference? That was revolution.

Numbers don't lie. They can't be charmed, bribed, or intimidated. They just count. And what they count, eventually, counts back.

## The Bread Equation

France, 1789: A worker earned 20 sous per day. Bread cost 8 sous per loaf. One family needed 2 loaves daily. 
Math: 20 - 16 = 4 sous for everything else.

Then bread hit 12 sous. Math: 20 - 24 = -4 sous. 
Negative survival. Revolution.

This isn't politics. It's arithmetic. When daily cost exceeds daily income, something breaks. Usually the government.

Track bread prices before any revolution. They spike. Always. Because bread is energy, and when energy becomes scarce, systems collapse. The French tracked bread prices like we track stock markets. They knew: when bread breaks 15 sous, blood flows.

## The Gini Coefficient of Doom

Economists use the Gini coefficient to measure inequality. 0 = everyone has equal wealth. 1 = one person has everything.

Pre-revolution markers:
- France 1789: 0.59 → 0.68 (revolution)
- Russia 1917: 0.51 → 0.65 (revolution)
- China 1949: 0.55 → 0.73 (revolution)
- USA 1776: 0.44 → 0.57 (revolution)

The magic number? Around 0.65-0.70. Above that, explosion. It's like pressure in a boiler. You can measure it. You can predict when it blows.

But here's what's scarier: the rate of change matters more than absolute level. France went from 0.59 to 0.68 in just 10 years. That acceleration? That's revolution fuel.

## The 90/10 Split

Simple measurement: What percentage of wealth does the top 10% control?

Stable societies: 40-50%
Unstable societies: 60-70%
Revolutionary societies: 80%+

France 1789: Top 10% owned 86% of land
Russia 1917: Top 10% controlled 84% of wealth
Mexico 1910: Top 10% owned 88% of property

When 10% control 80%+, the other 90% start doing math. Bad math. Revolutionary math.

## Liquidity Threshold

Your key insight: money is energy. But not all money. Liquid money. Money that moves.

Track M1 money supply (cash + checking accounts) versus total wealth:
- Healthy economy: 15-20% liquid
- Stressed economy: 10-15% liquid
- Pre-revolutionary: <10% liquid

France 1789: 6% liquidity. The rich had châteaus, art, land. The poor had nothing. Money stopped flowing. Energy stopped moving. System seized like an engine without oil.

This is your earthquake model. When too much wealth solidifies in immovable assets, economic tectonic plates lock. Pressure builds. Then sudden, violent release.

## The Three-Generation Rule

Measure wealth concentration by generation:

Generation 1: Builds wealth (0-30% concentration)
Generation 2: Consolidates wealth (30-60% concentration)
Generation 3: Hoards wealth (60%+ concentration)
Revolution.

It's clockwork. The builders remember poverty. Their children remember stories. Their grandchildren remember nothing. They hoard because they can, not because they should.

France's nobility in 1789? Third and fourth generation wealth. Russia's aristocracy in 1917? Third generation. America's robber barons in 1930s? Saved by Roosevelt's reforms at exactly the third generation mark.

## The Misery Index

Simple formula: Unemployment Rate + Inflation Rate = Misery Index

- Under 10: Stable
- 10-15: Grumbling
- 15-20: Protests
- Over 20: Revolution

France 1789: ~25 (15% unemployment + 10% inflation)
Germany 1923: ~1,000,000 (hyperinflation)
Russia 1917: ~35 (20% unemployment + 15% inflation)

But here's the hidden factor: add wealth inequality multiplier. 
Real Misery = (Unemployment + Inflation) × (Gini coefficient × 2)

This predicts better. Because 20% unemployment hurts more when the rich feast while you starve.

## The Youth Bulge

Demographics are destiny. Count the percentage of population aged 15-25:

- Under 15%: Stable
- 15-20%: Restless
- Over 20%: Revolutionary

France 1789: 22% aged 15-25
Russia 1917: 23% aged 15-25
Arab Spring 2011: 25%+ aged 15-25

Young people without opportunity are revolution fuel. They have energy, no assets, no stake in the system. They're all accelerator, no brakes.

## The Education Paradox

Measure: Literacy rate × Unemployment rate of educated

Rising literacy + falling opportunity = revolution

France 1789: Literacy jumped from 20% to 40% in 50 years. But educated jobs? Didn't double. Result: Educated, unemployed, angry young men. They wrote pamphlets. They read Rousseau. They made revolution.

This pattern repeats. Russia: rising education, no opportunities. Arab Spring: college graduates driving taxis. Education creates expectations. Blocked expectations create revolutionaries.

## The Network Density

Count coffee houses per capita. Seriously.

London 1650: 0 coffee houses → 1688: 3,000 coffee houses → Glorious Revolution
Paris 1750: 300 cafés → 1789: 1,800 cafés → French Revolution
Cairo 2000: Traditional cafés → 2011: Internet cafés → Arab Spring

Where people gather, ideas spread. Ideas spreading = pressure building. You can literally count revolution brewing by counting where people brew coffee (or today, Wi-Fi hotspots).

## The Price of Everything

Track price ratios:

Bread price ÷ Average wage = Survival ratio
Land price ÷ Annual income = Hope ratio
Education cost ÷ Expected earnings = Future ratio

When survival ratio > 0.8: Danger
When hope ratio > 20: Despair
When future ratio > 10: Rage

Combine all three > critical values? Revolution within 5 years. It's that predictable.

## The Velocity of Wealth

Your insight about money as energy is measurable:

Velocity = GDP ÷ Money Supply

- Healthy: 1.5-2.0 (money changes hands 1.5-2 times per year)
- Slowing: 1.0-1.5 (wealth accumulating)
- Frozen: <1.0 (money not moving)
- Revolutionary: <0.7 (energy stopped flowing)

France 1789: 0.6
Russia 1917: 0.5
USA 1929: 0.8 (saved by New Deal)

When velocity drops below 0.7, revolution or reform. No exceptions found.

## The Critical Mass

It's not about absolute numbers. It's about reaching critical mass:

Revolution happens when:
- Economic pressure > 70th percentile AND
- Youth bulge > 20% AND
- Wealth concentration > 80% AND
- Liquidity < 10% AND
- Velocity < 0.7

Hit all five? Revolution probability > 90%.
Miss one? Maybe protests, maybe reform.
Miss two? System survives.

## The Measurement Warning

Here's what's terrifying: we can measure this. We have the data. We can see revolutions coming like hurricanes on radar.

But we don't prevent them. Why? Because those who could act are those who benefit from the imbalance. They see the numbers. They ignore them. They think: "Not in my lifetime."

They're usually wrong about the timeline.

The numbers don't care about your politics. They don't respect your ideology. They just count. And when they count high enough, history happens.

Math is merciless. Revolution is math.

*Revolution isn't random. It's predictable. We have the equations. We can see it coming. The only mystery is why we act surprised when the math plays out exactly as the math said it would.*
