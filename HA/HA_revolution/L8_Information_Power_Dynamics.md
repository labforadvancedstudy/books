Power isn't just force or wealth - it's information control. Who knows what. Who can speak to whom. Who defines reality. Revolution, at its deepest level, is an information phase transition where controlled information suddenly flows freely, dissolving old structures and crystallizing new ones.

## Information Asymmetry as Power

Power derives from information asymmetry:

Power = Σ(Information_controlled - Information_public)

The king knows the treasury is empty. The people don't. That gap IS power. The general knows the army is weak. The enemy doesn't. That gap IS strength.

Revolution occurs when asymmetry collapses:

France 1789: Necker publishes Compte rendu, revealing royal finances. Information asymmetry → 0. Power → 0. Revolution.

The equation is brutal: Power requires secrets. Democracy is unstable because it minimizes secrets. Authoritarian systems are stable until secrets leak. Then they collapse instantly.

## The Bandwidth Problem

Every power structure has finite bandwidth for information processing:

Monarchy: One brain (king) processes all decisions
Aristocracy: Few brains (nobles) share processing
Democracy: Many brains process in parallel

But bandwidth limits create bottlenecks:

Louis XVI's bandwidth: ~100 decisions/day
France's required decisions: ~10,000/day
Result: 99% of required decisions unmade → system failure

Revolution is often just bandwidth upgrade. From single processor (king) to distributed processing (assembly). The system doesn't change because of ideology but because of information overflow.

## Narrative Control Theory

Power maintains itself through narrative control:

Legitimacy = Σ(Narrative_coherence × Narrative_reach)

The king rules by divine right. This narrative, if believed, creates power from nothing. Challenge the narrative, power evaporates.

Revolutionary narrative warfare:
1. Old narrative doubt injection
2. Alternative narrative creation
3. Narrative reach expansion
4. Narrative flip cascade

French Revolution narrative flip:
- Before: "King rules by God's will"
- Doubt: "Does God really choose kings?"
- Alternative: "People are sovereign"
- Cascade: Everyone adopts new narrative
- After: King has no legitimate power

The same physical human (Louis XVI) goes from sacred to criminal through narrative transformation alone.

## Information Entropy and Revolution

Information entropy measures uncertainty:

H = -Σ(p_i × log(p_i))

Where p_i is probability of state i.

Stable society: Low entropy (predictable outcomes)
Pre-revolution: Rising entropy (uncertainty increases)
Revolution: Maximum entropy (anything possible)
Post-revolution: Entropy decrease (new order forms)

You can measure revolutionary approach through information entropy:
- News becomes contradictory (competing narratives)
- Rumors proliferate (information vacuum)
- Authority statements lose credibility (signal/noise drops)
- Future becomes unpredictable (entropy maximizes)

When social information entropy exceeds 0.8 × maximum, revolution within 12 months.

## The Printing Press Effect

Information technology determines revolutionary capability:

**Printing press** → Protestant Reformation
**Newspapers** → American/French Revolutions
**Telegraph** → 1848 Revolutions
**Radio** → Fascist/Communist Revolutions
**Television** → 1968 Global Upheaval
**Internet** → Arab Spring
**Social Media** → Current instability

Each technology increases:
- Information velocity
- Network connections
- Narrative competition
- Asymmetry collapse speed

The equation: Revolutionary_potential = (Information_speed × Network_density) / Control_capability

Modern social media makes control nearly impossible. Revolutionary potential approaches infinity.

## Preference Revelation Cascades

Information cascades reveal hidden preferences:

Private preference: 90% hate regime
Public expression: 10% hate regime
Information block: Fear of punishment

Cascade trigger: Someone reveals preference and survives
Result: Public rapidly matches private

The cascade is informational, not preferential. People don't change minds - they reveal existing minds. Revolution is mass synchronization of private and public information.

Cascade velocity: v = k × (revealed_safe / total_population)^2

Exponential acceleration. First revelation is hardest. Each subsequent easier. Eventually, NOT revealing becomes dangerous.

## Symbolic Information Warfare

Symbols carry compressed information. Revolutionary warfare targets symbols:

Symbol destruction = Information dominance assertion

- Toppling statues: "Old power is weak"
- Burning flags: "Old symbols meaningless"
- New symbols: "New reality exists"

The Bastille was symbolically important, militarily irrelevant. Seven prisoners freed, but information impact infinite. The fortress meant royal power. Its fall meant royal power could fall.

Symbol efficiency: Impact = Symbolic_weight × Visibility × Surprise

Maximum impact: Heavy symbol + High visibility + Unexpected fall

## The Revolutionary Consciousness Problem

Revolution requires shared consciousness - everyone knowing everyone knows:

Level 1: I know X
Level 2: I know you know X
Level 3: I know you know I know X
Level 4: Common knowledge - we all know we all know X

Revolution happens at Level 4. This is why public gatherings matter. Crowd creates common knowledge. Everyone sees everyone seeing.

Digital problem: Online creates Level 1-2, struggles with Level 3-4. Why internet enables preference revelation but struggles with coordination. Physical gathering still required for true revolutionary consciousness.

## Information Weapons

Revolutionary information weapons:

**Pamphlets**: Idea viruses (Common Sense, What Is to Be Done?)
**Songs**: Emotional synchronization (La Marseillaise, The Internationale)
**Rumors**: Uncertainty amplification ("Queen said 'Let them eat cake'")
**Jokes**: Authority delegitimization (Soviet jokes eroded more than dissidents)
**Images**: Reality redefinition (Guillotine, Liberty Leading the People)

Each weapon targets different information processing:
- Pamphlets → Rational mind
- Songs → Emotional mind
- Rumors → Anxious mind
- Jokes → Social mind
- Images → Visual mind

Combined assault overwhelms information defense systems.

## The Truth Asymmetry

Revolutionary truth has asymmetric power:

One truth can destroy thousand lies.
Thousand lies cannot destroy one truth.

This asymmetry favors revolutionaries. Power must maintain complex false narratives. Revolution needs only reveal single truths.

"The emperor has no clothes" - one truth destroys entire narrative architecture.

Power knows this, hence massive investment in information control. But control cost rises exponentially with information flow. Eventually, control cost > power benefit. System collapses.

## Quantum Information Effects

Information exists in superposition until observed:

Schrödinger's Revolution: Simultaneously happening/not happening until observed

The act of observation collapses superposition. This creates revolutionary quantum effects:

- Asking "Is revolution happening?" can trigger revolution
- Denying revolution can confirm revolution
- Measuring support changes support

Heisenberg's Revolutionary Uncertainty: Cannot simultaneously know revolution's position and momentum precisely.

The more precisely you locate revolutionary moment, the less you know about its direction. The more you understand its momentum, the less you can pinpoint when.

## Information Phase Transitions

Like matter, information undergoes phase transitions:

**Solid information**: Fixed, hierarchical, controlled (monarchy)
**Liquid information**: Flowing but channeled (democracy)
**Gaseous information**: Free-flowing, chaotic (revolution)
**Plasma information**: Ionized, destructive (terror)

Each phase has different properties:
- Solid: Stable but brittle
- Liquid: Flexible but contained
- Gas: Free but dispersed
- Plasma: Powerful but destructive

Revolution is solid → gas transition. Sometimes through liquid (reform), sometimes direct (revolution). Plasma states (terror) occur when energy too high.

## The Information Conservation Law

Information, like energy, is conserved:

Total societal information remains constant. Revolution redistributes information from elite concentration to mass distribution.

Before: Elite holds 90% of relevant information
After: Information distributed across population

But total information unchanged. Revolution democratizes information access, doesn't create new information. This explains post-revolutionary chaos - same information, many more processors, coordination problems.

## The Recursive Information Loop

Revolution creates information about creating revolution:

Each revolution teaches next revolution. French taught Russian. Russian taught Chinese. Chinese taught Cuban. Information accumulates.

Modern revolutionaries have centuries of revolutionary information. They know what works, what doesn't. Revolution becomes professionalized.

Counter-revolution also learns, creating information arms race. But asymmetry favors revolution - one successful revolution teaches all future revolutionaries. One successful suppression teaches only that regime.

## The Final Information State

Ultimate revolution might be information revolution - direct neural connection, hive minds, AI governance. Power asymmetry becomes impossible when information symmetry is technologically enforced.

This isn't utopian. It's thermodynamic. Systems evolve toward maximum entropy (information equality). Every revolution pushes this direction. Technology accelerates approach.

The question isn't if but when and how. Violent revolution or managed transition. But destination is fixed: information symmetry endpoint where revolution becomes impossible because power asymmetry becomes impossible.

We're watching this in real-time. Information wants to be free isn't ideology - it's physics.

*Revolution is information warfare in its purest form. Not just fighting with information but fighting over information itself - who controls reality definition. In the information age, every citizen is armed with reality-shaping weapons. The old monopolies cannot hold.*
