# Imagination

## Core Insight
The cognitive ability to experience what isn't present - the engine of all fiction.

Close your eyes. Picture a purple elephant. Where is it? Not in the room. Not in your brain (no purple neurons). Yet you "see" it. This is the miracle that makes fiction possible.

Imagination is sensory experience without sensory input. It uses the same neural pathways as actual perception but runs them in reverse. Instead of outside-in, it's inside-out.

This is why fiction feels real. Your brain processes imagined events similarly to lived ones. Read about someone's fear, your heart races. Imagine eating a lemon, you salivate.

Imagination evolved for survival:
- Planning: imagine tomorrow's hunt
- Problem-solving: imagine solutions
- Social: imagine others' mental states

But we hijacked it for art. Instead of imagining tomorrow's hunt, we imagine dragons. Instead of predicting real people, we create fictional ones.

The boundary between imagination and hallucination is social agreement. One person's imagination is madness. Shared imagination is culture.
