# Story

## Core Insight
The fundamental unit of human meaning-making: events connected by causation and intention.

"First this happened, then that happened because of the first thing." The simplest story. But why do we do this? 

Reality doesn't come in stories. It's just one damn thing after another. But human brains can't handle pure sequence. We need causation, meaning, connection. So we impose story structure on chaos.

Every story is:
- Selection (what to include/exclude)
- Connection (this caused that)
- Meaning (why it matters)

A child's "I went to store and got candy" is structurally identical to the Odyssey. Beginning, middle, end. Desire, action, result.

Stories are how we encode information for memory. Pure facts slip away. Stories stick. "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell" survives because it's a micro-story - a character with a role.

We don't just tell stories. We ARE stories. Your identity is the story you tell yourself about who you are.
