# Metafiction

## Core Insight
Fiction aware of its own fictionality - stories that know they're stories.

When a character turns to the reader and winks, reality folds. The fourth wall isn't just broken - it's revealed as illusion. We're reminded we're reading/watching, yet somehow this makes it MORE engaging, not less.

Metafiction operates on multiple levels simultaneously:
- The story (what happens)
- The story about the story (how it's told)
- The story about stories (what fiction is)

Ancient as Quixote, modern as Deadpool. But why do we love it?

Because it mirrors consciousness itself. We're always aware of our own awareness. We think about thinking. Metafiction externalizes this recursive loop.

Types:
- Direct address ("Dear reader...")
- Nested stories (stories within stories)
- Self-reference (characters who know they're fictional)
- Genre awareness (characters who know the tropes)

The danger: cleverness without heart. Metafiction can become intellectual masturbation. The best uses the meta layer to deepen, not diminish, emotional impact.

Ultimate metafiction: reality itself. If we're simulations, every story is meta - fictions within the fiction of existence.
