# Narrative Consciousness

## Core Insight
Consciousness itself might be a story-telling mechanism - we ARE fiction.

What if consciousness isn't a thing but a process? Specifically, the process of constructing narrative from experience?

Consider:
- You wake: immediately story-fy ("I'm X, it's Tuesday, I must do Y")
- You remember: always as narrative, never as raw data
- You plan: by telling future stories
- You dream: pure narrative without logic

The self is a story you tell so consistently you believe it. "I" is the protagonist of an ongoing narrative constructed from:
- Selected memories (edited for consistency)
- Projected futures (desires as plot)
- Running commentary (internal narrator)
- Character consistency (personality)

Brain damage that disrupts narrative = disrupted self:
- Can't form new memories = stuck in time
- Can't project future = no motivation
- Can't maintain continuity = multiple personalities

We don't HAVE stories. We ARE stories. Consciousness is the tale told by neurons, signifying everything.

This explains fiction's power. When we read/watch stories, one narrative system recognizes another. Stories feel meaningful because consciousness IS story.
