# Collective Imagination

## Core Insight
When individual imaginations sync up, creating shared fictional realities that shape actual reality.

One person imagining: madness. Million people imagining same thing: culture.

How does individual imagination become collective?
- Shared stories (myths, movies)
- Shared symbols (flags, logos)
- Shared rituals (ceremonies, fandoms)
- Shared languages (memes, references)

The result: fictional constructs more powerful than physical reality.

Examples:
- Money (collective fiction of value)
- Nations (imagined communities)
- Corporations (legal fictions)
- Human rights (agreed-upon stories)

These aren't "just" stories. They create reality. Money works because we believe. Nations exist because we agree. The fiction IS the fact.

Fiction fandoms show this clearly. Harry Potter isn't "real" but:
- Shapes millions of identities
- Generates billions in economy
- Creates real communities
- Influences real behavior

The internet supercharged collective imagination. Now fictions spread at light speed, mutate rapidly, create instant communities.

We're living in overlapping fictional universes, each with its own logic. Reality is the negotiation between competing collective fictions.
