# Oral Tradition

## Core Insight
Fiction before writing: stories as living, breathing, evolving entities passed mouth to ear.

For 99% of human history, this was ALL fiction. No books. No scripts. Just memory, voice, and performance.

Oral stories aren't fixed texts performed. They're recreated each telling. The storyteller reads the room, adapts, improvises. The story lives because it changes.

Features of oral tradition:
- Formulaic phrases (aids memory)
- Repetition and rhythm (creates trance)
- Audience participation (call and response)
- Embodied performance (gesture, voice)
- Collective ownership (everyone's story)

The cognitive load was immense. Griots, bards, shamans - living libraries. Memory techniques we've lost: method of loci, rhythmic encoding, melodic association.

Oral stories were survival tools:
- History (who we are)
- Law (how to behave)
- Science (how world works)
- Navigation (songlines, story-maps)

Writing didn't just record oral tradition. It killed it. Fixed texts replaced fluid tellings. Authors replaced communities. Reading replaced gathering.

But oral tradition survives: jokes, gossip, urban legends. Stories that live by being told, not read.
