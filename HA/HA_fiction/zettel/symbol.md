# Symbol

## Core Insight
When one thing means another thing: the compression algorithm of meaning.

A rose isn't just a rose. It's love, beauty, mortality, secrecy. Symbols are meaning-dense packets that explode in the mind.

How symbols work:
1. Concrete object (rose)
2. Abstract association (love)
3. Cultural agreement (we all "know")
4. Contextual activation (in a love story)

Symbols are fiction's hyperlinks. They connect:
- Story to culture
- Specific to universal
- Concrete to abstract
- Conscious to unconscious

The power: symbols bypass rational thought. You don't decide a dark forest is scary. You FEEL it. Symbols talk directly to the old brain.

Great fiction uses symbols like:
- The green light (Gatsby's desire)
- The ring (power corruption)
- The whale (obsession/nature/God)

But heavy-handed symbolism kills story. Best symbols emerge naturally from the narrative and carry multiple meanings.

Modern problem: symbol inflation. Everything's symbolic. Nothing's just itself. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar - and that's okay.
