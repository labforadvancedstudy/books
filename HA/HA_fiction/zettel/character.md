# Character

## Core Insight
A persistent pattern of behaviors and desires that we recognize as "someone."

Characters are compression algorithms for human complexity. Real people are inconsistent, contradictory, unknowable. Characters are coherent, understandable, predictable enough to surprise us.

The magic: we bond with characters MORE than real people. We know Harry Potter better than our neighbors. We cry when fictional people die. We fall in love with patterns of words.

Why? Characters are purified humans. Distilled to essence. Hamlet is anyone who can't decide. Emma Bovary is anyone who wants more. They're more real than real because they're archetypal.

The paradox: 
- Too simple = cardboard
- Too complex = incoherent
- Just right = more alive than the living

Every character is a question: "What would a person like this do in that situation?" Fiction is running human simulations to find out.

We learn empathy through characters. By being someone else for 300 pages or 2 hours, we expand our own boundaries.
