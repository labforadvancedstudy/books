# Plot

## Core Insight
The skeleton of story: a sequence of events organized by causation and conflict toward resolution.

Plot is what happens. Story is what it means. Plot without story is just mechanics. Story without plot is just theme.

The universal plot: someone wants something, obstacles prevent them, they struggle, they succeed/fail/change. Every plot is variation on this.

Why this structure? It mirrors human experience:
- Desire (we always want)
- Obstacle (reality resists)
- Struggle (we must effort)
- Resolution (we succeed/fail/learn)

Classic shapes:
- Man in hole (fall then rise)
- Boy meets girl (together-apart-together)
- Cinderella (rise-fall-rise)
- Tragedy (rise then fall)

But plot is artificial. Life doesn't have clean beginnings or satisfying endings. Plot imposes meaning by selecting where to start and stop.

The plot paradox: must feel both surprising AND inevitable. If predictable, boring. If random, meaningless. The sweet spot: unexpected but retrospectively obvious.

Modern challenge: audiences know all plots. Solution: focus on execution, character, style. The plot serves the story, not vice versa.
