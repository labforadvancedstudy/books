# Archetype

## Core Insight
Universal character patterns that transcend culture: the source code of human personality.

Jung saw them in dreams and myths: Hero, Shadow, Wise Old Man, Great Mother. Same patterns everywhere, everywhen. As if humanity shares character templates.

Archetypes aren't stereotypes:
- Stereotype: lazy shorthand
- Archetype: deep pattern

The Hero isn't just brave guy. It's the part of us that faces fear. The Shadow isn't villain. It's our repressed aspects. They're psychological functions in character form.

Why do archetypes work?
- Recognition (we know these patterns)
- Projection (we are these patterns)
- Completion (we need these patterns)
- Evolution (we evolved these patterns)

Great characters embody archetypes while transcending them. Darth Vader is Shadow AND Father. Gandalf is Wise Old Man AND Trickster.

Modern fiction plays with archetypes:
- Subversion (tough princess, sensitive warrior)
- Combination (hero-villain, wise fool)
- Deconstruction (what makes a hero?)

But archetypes persist because they're psychological realities. We'll always need Heroes because we'll always need courage. We'll always have Shadows because we'll always have darkness.

Fiction is how archetypes incarnate and evolve.
