# Conflict

## Core Insight
The engine of story: opposing forces creating tension that demands resolution.

Without conflict, no story. "I wanted coffee. I got coffee. The end." Boring. "I wanted coffee but the shop was closed by zombies..." Now we're interested.

Types of conflict:
- Person vs Person (external)
- Person vs Self (internal)
- Person vs Nature (environmental)
- Person vs Society (systemic)
- Person vs Fate/God (cosmic)

But these categories mislead. All conflict is internal. External obstacles only matter because they create internal struggle.

The zombie isn't the conflict. The conflict is: risk death for coffee or stay safe but caffeine-deprived? The choice reveals character.

Great fiction layers conflicts:
- Surface: defeat the villain
- Deeper: overcome fear
- Deepest: accept mortality

Conflict creates:
- Stakes (what's at risk)
- Tension (will they succeed?)
- Change (victory or defeat transforms)
- Meaning (struggle defines us)

Modern challenge: we've seen all conflicts. Solution: fresh combinations, higher stakes, deeper internality. Or embrace the familiar but execute perfectly.

Ultimately, fiction is conflict because life is conflict. We read to see how others navigate the universal struggle.
