# Worldbuilding

## Core Insight
Creating complete realities: the divine act of making universes from nothing but imagination.

Worldbuilding is fiction's most godlike aspect. You create not just story but entire reality:
- Physical laws
- History and culture
- Languages and beliefs
- Geography and ecology
- Systems and relations

Great worldbuilding feels discovered, not invented. Middle-earth, Hogwarts, Westeros - they seem to exist independently of their stories.

The iceberg principle: show 10%, imply 90%. The world feels real because there's always more than you see. Every detail suggests vast unseen depths.

Worldbuilding serves story:
- Setting shapes plot
- Environment creates conflict
- Culture drives character
- Systems create possibilities

But worlds can overwhelm stories. Some creators love their worlds more than their characters. The world becomes the point, not the stage.

Digital age enables participatory worldbuilding:
- Wikis catalog every detail
- Fans extend canon
- Games let you explore
- Communities live there

We're approaching the holodeck: fully realized fictional worlds indistinguishable from reality. What happens when worldbuilding becomes world-making?
