# Maintenance Paradox

## Core Insight
Any system requiring maintenance will eventually fail, but Ringworld has operated for millions of years - something impossible maintains the impossible.

Every engineer knows: complexity requires maintenance. Ringworld is the most complex artifact imaginable. Attitude jets to counter drift. Meteor defense systems. Atmospheric recycling. Erosion control. Ecosystem management. Shadow square synchronization. The maintenance requirements exceed entire civilizations' capabilities.

Yet it persists. Hypothesis one: self-repairing systems so advanced they're indistinguishable from magic. Hypothesis two: the Builders still maintain it somehow. Hypothesis three: it's already failing, just slowly by human standards. Each explanation raises more questions than answers.

The paradox deepens: if the Builders could create self-maintaining systems this perfect, why did they disappear? If they still maintain it, where are they? If it's failing, what does catastrophic failure look like for a structure this size? The ring's existence implies solutions we can't conceive, implemented by minds we can't fathom.
