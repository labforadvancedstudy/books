# Ring Dimensions

## Core Insight
Build a world with the surface area of three million Earths - because why think small?

Radius: 93 million miles (1 AU - Earth's orbital distance). Width: 997,000 miles (about 125 Earth diameters). Circumference: 584 million miles. Total surface area: 6 × 10^14 square miles. That's three million times Earth's surface, all connected, all habitable, all yours.

The numbers break human comprehension. Light takes 8.3 minutes to cross the radius. Messages between opposite points take 16.6 minutes minimum. Weather systems can be larger than Jupiter. Mountain ranges stretch longer than the distance to Alpha Centauri. Rivers flow for billions of miles without reaching an ocean - because there are no oceans, only endless river systems.

This isn't just big - it's civilization-shatteringly vast. You could give every human who ever lived their own Texas-sized territory and barely use 1% of the surface. New species could evolve in isolated pockets. Entire civilizations could rise and fall unknown to their neighbors millions of miles away.
