# Path to Ringworld

## Core Insight
From Moon base to Ringworld isn't just scaling up - it's multiple phase transitions in how civilization thinks about space and purpose.

Stage 1: Moon/Mars bases. We learn to live off-Earth, recycle everything, create closed ecosystems. We're still planetary beings thinking in planetary terms. Success means surviving where we shouldn't.

Stage 2: Asteroid habitats. We hollow out rocks, spin them for gravity, create our own worlds. We stop needing planets. Space becomes home, not void. We think in cubic kilometers, not surface area.

Stage 3: O'Neill cylinders. We build from scratch, no asteroid needed. Pure engineering creates pure habitat. We master closed ecology, stable rotation, long-term maintenance. We become world-builders.

Stage 4: Swarm civilization. Millions of habitats, quadrillions of people. We disassemble planets for materials. Energy becomes currency. We think at stellar scales. Dyson sphere seems logical next step.

Stage 5: The choice. Dyson sphere for maximum energy? Or Ringworld for maximum experience? The civilization that chooses Ringworld has transcended efficiency optimization. They build not because they must, but because they can. Because life deserves grandeur. Because why not?
