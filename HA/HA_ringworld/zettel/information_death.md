# Information Death

## Core Insight
On Ringworld, distance murders information - knowledge has a half-life measured in miles, not years.

Send a message to someone a million miles away. It travels at light speed, arrives in 5.3 seconds. But their response takes another 5.3 seconds. For complex exchanges, add processing time. Now multiply by realistic distances - billion-mile civilizations can't have conversations. By the time information arrives, it's archaeology.

Worse: information degrades with retransmission. Each civilization interprets through its own context, languages drift, technologies diverge. A technical manual becomes mythology in a thousand retellings. Scientific knowledge becomes cargo cult ritual. The original Builder manuals might still exist, but they're incomprehensible as Linear A.

Result: each region rediscovers everything independently. The wheel is reinvented a million times. Basic physics is derived from scratch by every isolated pocket. The ring hosts millions of parallel scientific revolutions, each thinking they're the first. The greatest library imaginable, but every book is in a different untranslatable language.
