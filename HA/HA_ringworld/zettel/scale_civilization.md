# Scale Civilization

## Core Insight
When your world is three million times larger than Earth, human concepts of society, culture, and governance become quaint impossibilities.

Earth's entire history fits in a space smaller than Ringworld's measurement error. Empires that spanned continents would be invisible dots. The Roman Empire at its peak would be a neighborhood. All human civilization would be a rounding error in one small section of one small region.

Communication destroys unity. Radio signals take hours to cross significant fractions. By the time central authority's commands arrive, the situation changed. Local independence isn't politics - it's physics. Every region must be self-sufficient because help is always too far away. The speed of light becomes the speed of cultural drift.

Result: millions of independent civilizations, each thinking they're alone. Technologies diverge. Languages become unrecognizable. Humans speciate. What starts as one civilization becomes millions of aliens who happen to share ancestors. The ring doesn't unite - it isolates on unprecedented scales.
