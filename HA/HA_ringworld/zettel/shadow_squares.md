# Shadow Squares

## Core Insight
When your world has no axial tilt and can't rotate, you fake night by building a cosmic venetian blind.

Twenty rectangular panels, each a million miles by two and a half million miles, orbiting between Ringworld and its sun. They're connected by invisible wire - probably the same impossible material family as scrith. As they orbit, they cast moving shadows across the ring's surface, creating 30-hour day/night cycles.

The engineering is absurd. Each square masses more than Earth's moon. They must maintain perfect spacing while orbiting at different velocities (inner squares move faster). Any drift means permanent night or eternal day for millions of square miles. Yet they've operated flawlessly for perhaps millions of years.

But shadow squares are more than timekeepers. They're heat regulators, preventing the eternal noon that would bake the ring's sunward surface. They create weather patterns as land cools and heats. They give biological rhythms to a world that would otherwise exist in perpetual, maddening daylight. Artificial night for an artificial world.
