# Spin Gravity

## Core Insight
When you can't have mass, fake it with motion - centripetal acceleration becomes your new down.

Ringworld doesn't orbit its star; it spins. One million miles radius, 770 miles per second rim velocity. The spin creates outward acceleration that feels exactly like gravity to anything standing on the inner surface. Your feet press against the ring, the ring pushes back. Newton's third law becomes your weight.

The beauty: it's uniform. Unlike planets with weaker gravity at poles, stronger at equator, Ringworld provides consistent 1g everywhere. No altitude sickness from climbing mountains. No pressure changes. Just endless, perfect, artificial gravity stretching three million miles around.

But spin gravity has quirks. Drop something and it falls straight "down" - but the ring moved while it fell. Coriolis effects twist weather patterns. Rivers flow strangely. Ballistics becomes art. Your intuition, evolved on a spinning sphere, lies to you on a spinning ring.
