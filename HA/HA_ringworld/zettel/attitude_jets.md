# Attitude Jets

## Core Insight
Even a structure massing more than a million Earths needs course corrections - physics doesn't care about your size.

Ringworld is dynamically unstable. Any perturbation - solar wind pressure, gravitational tugs from planets, impacts from space debris - pushes it off center. Without correction, the ring would drift into its sun within decades. The Builders' solution: attitude jets along the rim, powerful enough to move mountains because they literally move a mountain range's worth of ring.

These aren't rockets - they're ramscoops, gathering interstellar hydrogen and expelling it as plasma. Each jet could propel a spacecraft to near light-speed. Thousands of them firing in concert can nudge Ringworld back to position. The energy requirements exceed most civilizations' total output, spent on microscopic adjustments.

But the jets reveal vulnerability. They're mechanical systems requiring maintenance. They need fuel, even if gathered from space. They can fail, be damaged, be sabotaged. The ring's stability depends on technology working perfectly for millions of years. One systemic failure and the greatest artifact becomes the greatest catastrophe.
