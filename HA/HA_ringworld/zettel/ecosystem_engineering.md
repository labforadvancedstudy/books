# Ecosystem Engineering

## Core Insight
Building a world means building ten billion interconnected ecosystems from scratch - playing God at continental scales.

You can't just spin up a ring and add water. Every ecosystem needs designed - predator-prey ratios, nutrient cycles, genetic diversity, climate zones. But Ringworld has no natural barriers. No oceans to separate continents. No mountains to create rain shadows (unless you build them). Evolution needs isolation, but the ring is continuous.

The Builders solved this through deliberate diversity. Engineered mountain ranges every few million miles. River systems that create natural boundaries. Deserts as firebreaks between biomes. Each section becomes a vast experimental plot, seeded with different life, evolving independently. The ring becomes a billion petri dishes, each developing unique solutions to existence.

But ecosystems drift. Successful species spread. Invasive organisms cross barriers. The careful balance tips. After millions of years, has the original design survived? Or has the ring evolved its own meta-ecosystem, as far from the Builders' intent as Earth's current biosphere is from the Archaean?
