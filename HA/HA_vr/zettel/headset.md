# Headset

## Core Insight
The portal worn on the face - humanity's first successful attempt to replace biological reality with digital alternatives.

A VR headset is more than display technology. It's a sensory replacement system. Block natural light, substitute artificial. Hijack stereoscopic vision. Track head movement. Create a wearable alternate reality.

The weight matters. The fit matters. The sweet spot matters. Because this isn't just hardware - it's the physical interface between realities. Too heavy, and presence breaks. Too loose, and immersion fails. The headset is where flesh meets digital.
