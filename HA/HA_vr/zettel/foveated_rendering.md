# Foveated Rendering

## Core Insight
Render only what the eye can see - exploiting biology's limitations to overcome technology's constraints.

Human vision is a lie we tell ourselves. Only the fovea sees sharply; peripheral vision is impressionistic blur. Foveated rendering embraces this truth: track where eyes look, render that area in high detail, fake the rest. The eye's weakness becomes computation's strength.

This optimization reveals deeper truth about perception. We think we see everything clearly, but consciousness constructs complete images from partial data. VR doesn't need to render reality - just convince the visual system it has. Efficiency through deception.
