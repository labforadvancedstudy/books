# Six Degrees of Freedom (6DOF)

## Core Insight
The complete vocabulary of spatial existence - three ways to move, three ways to turn, together defining all possible positions in space.

6DOF tracking is the difference between looking through a window (3DOF) and being in a room. Translation (X, Y, Z) lets you walk, crouch, lean. Rotation (pitch, yaw, roll) lets you look around naturally. Together, they reconstruct the full grammar of physical presence.

This completeness matters. Miss one degree, and presence breaks. Early VR with only rotational tracking felt like being a mounted camera. Add translation, and suddenly you have a body in space. 6DOF is the minimum viable embodiment.
