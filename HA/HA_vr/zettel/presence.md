# Presence

## Core Insight
The magic moment when the mind forgets the technology and accepts the illusion - "being there" despite knowing you're not.

Presence is VR's holy grail. Not just seeing a virtual world, but feeling located within it. Your conscious mind knows it's fake, but deeper systems believe. You flinch at virtual threats. You fear virtual heights. You reach for virtual objects.

This isn't about graphics quality or frame rates. Presence emerges from coherence - when all sensory signals align to support the illusion. Break one element, and presence shatters like glass. Maintain coherence, and consciousness relocates.
