# Motion Sickness

## Core Insight
When eyes and inner ear disagree, the body assumes poison and rebels - evolution's bug becoming VR's biggest challenge.

VR motion sickness reveals our sensory systems' deep integration. Visual system says "moving," vestibular system says "stationary." This conflict triggers ancient anti-poison response: nausea, sweating, fatigue. Your body literally thinks you've been poisoned when reality signals don't match.

The irony: our most sophisticated technology defeated by our most primitive reflex. Millions of years of evolution didn't prepare us for moving through space while sitting still. Every comfort option, every locomotion scheme is a workaround for this fundamental mismatch.
