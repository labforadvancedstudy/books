# Consensus Hallucination

## Core Insight
When shared virtual experiences become indistinguishable from shared reality - the collective dream made manifest.

William Gibson called cyberspace a "consensus hallucination." VR literalizes this metaphor. Multiple people, different locations, same virtual space, shared experience. Not watching the same movie but inhabiting the same unreality together. Collective presence in non-existent places.

This challenges reality's definition. If experience is shared, consistent, consequential - is it less real because it's virtual? When millions attend virtual concerts, form virtual relationships, build virtual lives, the "hallucination" becomes a parallel reality track. Consensus creates reality, not substrate.
