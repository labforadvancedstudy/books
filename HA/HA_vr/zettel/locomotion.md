# Locomotion

## Core Insight
The fundamental challenge of infinite virtual space within finite physical rooms - how to let minds travel while bodies stay put.

Locomotion in VR exposes the central paradox: we want to explore vast virtual worlds from small physical spaces. Every solution is a compromise between presence and practicality, comfort and immersion.

Natural walking preserves presence but limits exploration. Teleportation prevents sickness but breaks continuity. Smooth locomotion via controller feels artificial. Each method reveals something about how movement and identity intertwine. We are not just minds that have bodies - we are bodies that move through space.
