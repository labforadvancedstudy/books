### Usage Notes

1. Each zettel contains one atomic concept in 10-30 lines
2. Zettels interconnect through conceptual relationships
3. Read in any order - each is self-contained
4. The collection forms a web revealing transportation's true nature
5. New zettels can be added as understanding deepens

### Key Insights Across Zettels

- Movement predates life and enables it
- Every increase in speed changes society
- Infrastructure shapes civilization more than politics
- The journey matters more than destination
- We ARE movement temporarily self-aware

### The Network Effect

These zettels don't just describe transportation - they form a transportation system for ideas. Each concept is a station, each connection a route. Your understanding can take multiple paths through the network, arriving at insights through different journeys.

*This zettelkasten is itself transportation - moving concepts between minds, carrying understanding across time, enabling intellectual journeys. As you read, you don't just learn about movement. You participate in the eternal exchange of pattern and meaning that IS movement.*
