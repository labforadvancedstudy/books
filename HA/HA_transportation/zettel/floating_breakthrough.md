# The Floating Breakthrough

## Core Insight
When humans learned to float, we didn't just cross water - we discovered how to make gravity work for us instead of against us, opening 71% of Earth's surface to exploration.

The first human who grabbed a floating log after falling into water discovered something profound: water could carry loads that would crush a human spine. Buoyancy was our first anti-gravity technology.

From hollow reeds to dugout canoes to multi-masted ships, each iteration exploited the same principle: displacement. By pushing water aside, we could carry tons with the effort of pounds. Rivers became highways, seas became bridges, oceans became pathways to new worlds.

Water transport inverted the usual physics of movement. On land, we fight friction and gravity. On water, we harness buoyancy and current. This inversion enabled civilization-scale transport millennia before engines.
