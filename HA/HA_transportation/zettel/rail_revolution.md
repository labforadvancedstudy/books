# The Rail Revolution

## Core Insight
Rails didn't just guide wheels - they created the first artificial geography, allowing us to impose mathematical perfection onto chaotic terrain and achieve speeds that biology never imagined.

The genius of rail isn't the train but the track. By constraining motion to one dimension, rails eliminate steering, reduce friction to steel-on-steel, and enable massive loads. A single locomotive can pull what would require thousands of horses.

Rails are humanity's first large-scale terraforming. We carved through mountains, bridged valleys, and laid ruler-straight lines across continents. Each rail line was a declaration: physics trumps geography.

The railroad created industrial time. Suddenly, schedules mattered to the second. Time zones were invented to coordinate trains. The precise, mechanical rhythm of rail transport synchronized human activity across vast distances, creating the clockwork society we inhabit today.
