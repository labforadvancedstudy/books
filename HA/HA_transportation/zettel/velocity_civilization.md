# Velocity and Civilization

## Core Insight
Civilization's complexity correlates directly with its maximum velocity - each order of magnitude increase in speed enables new forms of social organization, from villages at walking speed to global culture at jet speed.

Walking speed (5 km/h) created villages - communities where everyone could reach the center and return in a day. Horse speed (50 km/h) enabled kingdoms - territories governable by mounted messengers. Train speed (200 km/h) built nation-states - vast areas unified by rail networks.

Jet speed (900 km/h) created true globalization - any point reachable within 24 hours made planetary civilization possible. Light speed (300,000 km/s) enables instant global communication, creating the hive mind of the internet age.

Each velocity jump doesn't just serve existing civilization - it creates new civilization forms. We can't predict what near-light-speed travel would create any more than medieval peasants could predict the internet. But the pattern is clear: velocity sets the scale of possible society.
