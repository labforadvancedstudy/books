# Engine Evolution

## Core Insight
Engines are humanity's artificial muscles - devices that convert stored energy into directed motion, breaking our dependence on biological power and unleashing exponential growth in transportation capability.

The progression is elegant: human muscle → animal muscle → water wheel → windmill → steam engine → internal combustion → jet turbine → rocket → ion drive. Each step multiplies power while shrinking the power-to-weight ratio.

Steam engines taught us that heat is motion waiting to happen. Internal combustion showed that explosions could be tamed into smooth rotation. Jets revealed that Newton's third law could push us to near-sonic speeds. Rockets proved that we could create our own reaction mass.

Every engine embodies the same principle: create pressure differential, harness the flow. Whether it's steam pushing pistons or plasma streaming from ion drives, engines are pressure gradient machines. We've just gotten better at creating and controlling those gradients.
