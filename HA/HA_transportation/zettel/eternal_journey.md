# The Eternal Journey

## Core Insight
Transportation isn't about destinations but about the journey itself - movement is humanity's rebellion against entropy, our declaration that we refuse to stay where the universe dropped us.

Every species accepts its ecological niche, its geographic limits. Not humans. We looked at oceans and built boats. We looked at sky and built wings. We looked at space and built rockets. We look at the speed of light and plot ways around it.

This isn't mere restlessness but existential necessity. To stop moving is to stop growing, to stop growing is to start dying. Transportation technology is life's way of expanding its possibility space, of saying "not here, not yet, not ever."

The ultimate journey has no end. From the first human who walked out of Africa to the last human who will leave the solar system, we're on one continuous journey. Every wheel that turns, every wing that lifts, every rocket that fires continues the same motion that began when the first cell swam toward food. We don't move to get somewhere. We move because movement is what life does.
