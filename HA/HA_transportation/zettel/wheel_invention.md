# The Wheel Revolution

## Core Insight
The wheel didn't just reduce friction - it transformed linear effort into rotational infinity, creating the first mechanical advantage that could accumulate energy over distance.

The wheel seems obvious in hindsight, yet it took humanity thousands of years to invent. Why? Because nature rarely uses wheels - biology prefers legs, wings, and fins. The wheel is our first truly artificial movement principle.

A wheel converts sliding friction into rolling friction, reducing resistance by orders of magnitude. But more profoundly, it creates continuous motion from discrete pushes. Each rotation builds on the last, storing momentum like a mechanical battery.

The true revolution wasn't the wheel alone but the wheel-and-axle system. This simple machine multiplies force, changes direction of effort, and enables everything from potter's wheels to planetary gears.
