# The Death of Distance

## Core Insight
Transportation technology is humanity's war against distance - each innovation doesn't just cover distance faster but fundamentally redefines what distance means, progressively deleting space from the human experience.

Distance once meant danger, separation, and loss. A journey of months might be forever - travelers often never returned. Distance was death's cousin, separating loved ones with the finality of geography.

Each transportation advance killed distance a little more. Trains made cross-country into days. Jets made cross-ocean into hours. Telecommunications made cross-planet instantaneous. We're approaching distance-zero for information and distance-minimal for matter.

But distance dies unevenly. In cities, a mile might take an hour. In plains, a hundred miles might take the same. Time-distance replaced geographic distance, creating a wrinkled map where proximity has nothing to do with actual space. We live in distance-time now, not distance-space.
