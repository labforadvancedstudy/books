# Warfare and Mobility

## Core Insight
Military necessity has driven transportation innovation more than commerce or convenience - the need to move forces quickly has repeatedly shattered speed and distance barriers, with civilian benefits as afterthoughts.

Every transportation breakthrough has military origins or applications. Horses were weapons platforms before they were farming tools. Roman roads were troop highways before trade routes. Railroads moved armies before commuters. Aviation advanced more in WWI than the previous decade of peace.

The equation is brutal: mobility = survival. Armies that move faster can concentrate force, exploit weaknesses, and escape destruction. From Mongol horse archers to blitzkrieg tanks to aircraft carriers, military dominance has always been mobility dominance.

Even space technology emerged from ICBMs. The same rockets that threatened nuclear annihilation enabled lunar landings. GPS guides missiles and Uber drivers. The internet began as nuclear-attack-resistant communication. War's transportation demands become peace's infrastructure.
