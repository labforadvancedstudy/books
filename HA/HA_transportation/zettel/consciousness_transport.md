# Consciousness Transport

## Core Insight
The ultimate transportation might not move matter at all but transfer patterns - if consciousness is information, then the fastest travel is copying and deleting, not physical movement through space.

Every transportation technology has moved atoms: walking moves human atoms, ships move atoms across water, rockets move atoms through vacuum. But what if that's thinking at the wrong level? What if we could move the pattern while leaving the atoms behind?

Teleportation via quantum entanglement hits fundamental limits. But consciousness might not need quantum coherence - just pattern fidelity. Scan here, transmit information, reconstruct there. The philosophical puzzle (is the copy "you"?) might matter less than the practical result: apparent faster-than-light travel.

This isn't science fiction but logical endpoint. We're already comfortable with sleep (consciousness interrupted), anesthesia (consciousness suspended), and gradual atom replacement (consciousness persisted). The transition from moving matter to moving patterns might be less dramatic than from walking to flying.
