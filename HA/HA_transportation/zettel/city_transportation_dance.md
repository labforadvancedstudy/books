# City-Transportation Dance

## Core Insight
Cities and transportation systems co-evolve in an endless feedback loop - transportation shapes cities which demand new transportation which reshapes cities, each iteration creating new forms of human settlement.

The walking city was dense and mixed-use - everything within a 30-minute walk. The streetcar city stretched along rail lines like fingers. The automobile city exploded into suburbs. Each transportation technology didn't just serve the existing city - it created an entirely new city form.

Elevators made skyscrapers possible, creating vertical cities. Subways enabled megacities by moving millions without surface congestion. Highways created edge cities where suburbs became job centers. Each transport innovation rewrites urban DNA.

Now we're seeing the next iteration: ride-sharing reduces parking needs, e-bikes extend the cycling city, autonomous vehicles promise to reshape everything again. Cities are transportation crystallized into concrete and culture. Change how we move, and we change how we live.
