# Animal Domestication for Transport

## Core Insight
We didn't just tame animals - we merged nervous systems, creating hybrid organisms where human intelligence directed non-human strength and endurance.

The domestication of horses, oxen, camels, and dogs for transportation represents humanity's first biotechnology. We selectively bred for traits that amplified our own capabilities: strength we lacked, speed we couldn't achieve, endurance we couldn't sustain.

Each species offered unique advantages. Horses provided speed and war-making power. Oxen offered raw strength for heavy loads. Camels enabled desert crossings. Dogs pulled sleds across frozen wastes. We became a multi-species transportation network.

This wasn't mere exploitation but co-evolution. Horses' backs changed shape to accommodate riders. Dogs developed an uncanny ability to read human intentions. We shaped each other through millennia of shared journeys.
