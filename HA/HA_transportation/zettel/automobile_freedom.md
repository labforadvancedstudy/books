# Automobile Freedom

## Core Insight
The automobile didn't just replace horses - it privatized transportation, making every individual a sovereign of their own movement and rewriting the social contract around personal mobility.

Before cars, transportation was communal. You walked with others, rode scheduled trains, or shared coaches. The automobile created a new category: personal rapid transit. Suddenly, you could go anywhere, anytime, alone.

This wasn't just technological but psychological revolution. The car became an extension of the home - a private space that moved. Teenagers found freedom. Suburbs became possible. Dating changed. Privacy became mobile.

The automobile reshaped cities more than any war. Parking lots consumed downtowns. Highways carved neighborhoods. Shopping moved to malls. The walking city became the driving city. We rebuilt our entire civilization around the assumption of personal mechanical transportation.
