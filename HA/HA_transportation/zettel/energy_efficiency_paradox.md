# Energy Efficiency Paradox

## Core Insight
The more efficient transportation becomes, the more energy we use for it - efficiency doesn't reduce consumption but enables previously impossible journeys, expanding the universe of trips we consider reasonable.

Walking is incredibly efficient - humans get about 200 miles per gallon equivalent. But we abandoned walking for cars that get 30 mpg. Why? Because efficiency isn't the goal - capability is. We gladly trade efficiency for speed, comfort, and range.

This paradox repeats at every scale. More efficient engines don't reduce fuel use - they enable bigger vehicles and longer trips. More efficient planes don't save jet fuel - they make flying cheap enough that millions more fly. Efficiency enables expansion.

The fundamental truth: transportation isn't about minimizing energy use but maximizing possibility space. Each efficiency gain doesn't shrink our energy footprint but expands our movement sphere. We don't want to use less energy to go the same places - we want to use the same energy to go impossible places.
