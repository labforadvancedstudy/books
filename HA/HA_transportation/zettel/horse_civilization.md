# Horse and Civilization

## Core Insight
The horse didn't just carry riders - it carried entire civilizations, compressing continents and accelerating history from biological to technological timescales.

When humans first mounted horses around 3500 BCE, we gained a 10x multiplier on speed and range. But the deeper change was temporal - decisions that once took seasons now took days. Empires could respond to threats in weeks instead of months.

The stirrup (invented around 300 CE) was as revolutionary as the wheel. It transformed riders from passengers into stable weapons platforms. Mounted warriors could now use both hands for combat while controlling their horse with legs and weight shifts. This simple device toppled empires and created new ones.

Horse civilizations - Mongols, Huns, Plains Indians - organized society around mobility. Their cities were portable, their wealth was rideable, their worldview was velocity. The horse created the first high-speed cultures.
