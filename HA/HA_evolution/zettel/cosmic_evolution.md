# Cosmic Evolution

## Core Insight
The universe itself evolves - from quantum fluctuations to consciousness, reality undergoes its own selection process.

Evolution predates life. After the Big Bang, quantum fluctuations evolved into particles. Particles into atoms. Atoms into stars. Stars created heavy elements. Elements enabled chemistry. Chemistry enabled life. Life enabled mind. Mind contemplates its origin.

Lee Smolin proposed cosmological natural selection: universes reproduce through black holes, constants vary slightly, universes fine-tuned for black hole production dominate. Our universe's bio-friendliness is a side effect of black hole optimization.

But perhaps consciousness is the selector. Anthropic principle: we observe this universe because only consciousness-permitting universes have observers. Evolution at the grandest scale - universes competing for existence through their ability to evolve observers.

The deepest view: evolution is how existence explores its own possibilities. From quantum to cosmic scales, the same algorithm operates - variation, selection, amplification. Reality evolves toward knowing itself. We're how the universe becomes self-aware.
