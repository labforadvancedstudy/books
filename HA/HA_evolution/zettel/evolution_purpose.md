# Evolution's Purpose

## Core Insight
Evolution has no purpose yet creates purpose - blind processes generate goal-directed agents in an existential paradox.

The paradox cuts deep: evolution is mindless yet creates minds. Purposeless yet generates purpose-driven organisms. Random yet produces apparent design. How can meaninglessness create meaning?

Traditional view: evolution is pure mechanism, purpose is illusion. But consider: once consciousness evolves, organisms genuinely have goals. Evolution bootstrapped purpose from purposelessness. Real teleology emerged from fake teleology.

Perhaps purpose is evolution's emergent property. Like wetness emerges from H2O molecules, purpose emerges from sufficient complexity. Evolution doesn't have purpose but creates systems that do. The universe evolved its own meaning-makers.

Or deeper: maybe evolution tends toward awareness because conscious systems better navigate reality. Not guided, but statistically biased toward consciousness. Purpose as strange attractor in possibility space. Meaning as convergent solution.
