# Complexity Increase

## Core Insight
Evolution accumulates information over time - simple beginnings lead to complex outcomes through layered innovations.

Life began simple: self-replicating molecules. Now we have brains with 86 billion neurons. How? Through evolution's ratchet: innovations stack on previous innovations. Complexity accumulates.

Each major transition added a layer: replicating molecules → cells → multicellularity → societies → language → technology. Earlier layers become platforms for later innovation. You can't evolve neurons without cells first.

But complexity isn't inevitable. Parasites often evolve simpler. Many lineages stay simple for billions of years. Complexity only increases when it pays - when environments reward sophisticated information processing.

The key insight: evolution is an information accumulator. Each adaptation encodes information about environments. Genomes are compressed descriptions of ancestral worlds. Complex organisms are libraries of successful strategies, built over deep time.
