# Digital Evolution

## Core Insight
Evolution in silicon proceeds millions of times faster than carbon - artificial life explores possibility space at computational speed.

In 1990, Tom Ray created Tierra - digital organisms competing for CPU time and memory. They evolved parasites, immunity, hyperparasites. Entire ecosystems emerged from self-replicating code. Evolution doesn't need wetware.

Digital evolution reveals pure evolutionary dynamics. No chemistry constraints, no physical laws limiting morphology. Organisms can have any structure code allows. Evolution explores spaces biology cannot reach.

The speed is revolutionary. Millions of generations run overnight. We can replay evolution, test hypotheses, explore counterfactuals. What if mutation rates were higher? What if sex never evolved? Run the experiment.

AI systems now evolve. Neural networks mutate and recombine. Genetic algorithms design antennas, circuits, art. We're witnessing evolution's phase transition - from unconscious to directed, from biological to digital, from found to engineered.
