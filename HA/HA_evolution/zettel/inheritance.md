# Inheritance

## Core Insight
Like begets like - offspring resemble parents because traits pass through generations.

Before we understood DNA, farmers knew this truth: breed the best with the best, get better offspring. Children look like their parents. Dogs breed true to type. This isn't magic - it's inheritance.

Inheritance is evolution's memory system. Without it, each generation would start from scratch. No progress could accumulate. But because traits pass on, beneficial changes can spread through populations.

The mechanism is elegant: DNA carries instructions, cells copy DNA, offspring receive copies. Not perfect copies - small errors creep in. But faithful enough that a cat always produces kittens, never puppies.

What gets inherited? Physical traits, behaviors, even disease susceptibilities. Some traits follow simple patterns (eye color), others are complex (intelligence). But the principle remains: information flows from parent to child, carrying evolution's gains forward.
