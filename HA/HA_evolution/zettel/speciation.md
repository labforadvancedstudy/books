# Speciation

## Core Insight
One species becomes two - the multiplication of life's diversity through reproductive isolation.

Every species on Earth - millions of them - descended from a single ancestral cell. How? Through speciation, evolution's branching process. One lineage splits into two that can no longer interbreed.

Usually starts with geographic separation. A river changes course, splitting a population. Each side evolves independently. Different mutations arise, different selections operate. Drift pulls them apart randomly.

Given enough time, populations diverge so much they can't produce fertile offspring even if reunited. Horses and donkeys make sterile mules. Lions and tigers make weak ligers. The species boundary has formed.

But geography isn't required. Polyploidy (genome duplication) creates instant speciation in plants. Sexual selection can drive rapid divergence. Even symbiotic bacteria can create reproductive barriers. Life finds many ways to split.
