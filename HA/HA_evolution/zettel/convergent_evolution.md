# Convergent Evolution

## Core Insight
Different lineages independently evolve similar solutions - physics constrains biology's creativity.

Wings evolved at least four times: insects, pterosaurs, birds, bats. Each solved flight differently, but all have airfoils. Eyes evolved 40+ times. Echolocation evolved in bats and dolphins. Same problems, similar solutions.

This isn't coincidence - it's physics. To fly, you need lift. To see, you need photon detection. To echolocate, you need ultrasound. The laws of nature create a limited solution space that evolution explores repeatedly.

Convergence reveals deep patterns. Dolphins and sharks have similar body shapes because hydrodynamics demands it. Desert plants worldwide evolve thick skins and spines. Cave animals independently lose eyes and pigment.

The implications are profound. If we reran evolution's tape, we'd get different species but similar forms. Intelligence might be inevitable given enough time. On other planets, life would face the same physics, likely finding similar solutions.
