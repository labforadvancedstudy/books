# Divergent Evolution

## Core Insight
Common ancestors split into dramatically different forms - evolution's creative explosion from shared beginnings.

Start with a generalized ancestor. Now put its descendants in different environments. Watch them transform. Darwin's finches began as one species. Now there are seed-crackers with massive beaks, nectar-sippers with thin beaks, tool-users that prize grubs from bark.

Divergence is evolution's experimentation. The mammalian forelimb became a bat's wing, a whale's flipper, a mole's shovel, a human's hand. Same bones, wildly different functions. Evolution as tinkerer, repurposing old parts.

Adaptive radiation accelerates divergence. Empty niches invite exploration. After mass extinctions, survivors explode into vacant ecological roles. Mammals after dinosaurs. Cichlid fish in African lakes. Hawaiian honeycreepers from one ancestor.

The pattern reveals evolution's opportunism. Given variation and vacant niches, life diversifies explosively. One becomes many, similar becomes different, generalist becomes specialist. It's creation through division.
