# Cultural Evolution

## Core Insight
Human culture evolves through imitation and innovation - ideas spread, mutate, and compete like genes.

Humans broke evolution's speed limit. Genetic evolution takes generations. Cultural evolution updates in real-time. A useful invention spreads globally in years, not millennia. We evolve through ideas, not just genes.

Languages demonstrate cultural evolution beautifully. Words are born, meanings drift, grammatical structures simplify or complexify. Latin fragmented into Italian, Spanish, French - cultural speciation. Internet creates new dialects daily.

The mechanism parallels biological evolution. Variation comes from creativity and errors. Transmission occurs through learning. Selection happens via usefulness, memorability, or social pressure. But it's Lamarckian - acquired traits pass on.

This creates runaway evolution. Each generation starts where the last ended, not from scratch. Knowledge accumulates exponentially. A modern physicist knows more than Newton. We stand on giants' shoulders, then become giants for the next generation.
