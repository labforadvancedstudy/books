# Hierarchical Selection

## Core Insight
Selection operates at multiple levels simultaneously - genes, cells, organisms, groups all compete and cooperate.

Evolution isn't just organisms competing. It's a nested hierarchy of replicators. Genes compete within genomes. Cells compete within bodies. Individuals compete within groups. Groups compete with other groups. Different levels, different interests.

Cancer illustrates the conflict. A cell lineage evolves to replicate faster, breaking multicellular cooperation. It wins at the cellular level but kills the organism. Selection at one level undermines another.

But cooperation emerges when levels align. Cells in your body mostly cooperate because they share genes. Social insects form superorganisms through kin selection. Human groups cooperate through culture and reciprocity.

The insight transforms evolution. It's not just selfish genes or group selection - it's both, simultaneously, in tension. Major transitions occur when higher levels suppress lower-level competition. New individuals emerge from old collectives.
