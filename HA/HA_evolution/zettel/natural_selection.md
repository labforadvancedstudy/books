# Natural Selection

## Core Insight
Differential survival and reproduction - nature automatically selects what works.

Darwin's dangerous idea was beautifully simple: more organisms are born than can survive, they vary in traits, some traits help survival, survivors pass on their traits. That's it. No designer needed.

Think of it as a filter. Every generation, nature tests every organism. Too slow? Eaten. Wrong color? Spotted by predators. Can't find food? Starve. Only survivors reproduce.

It's not "survival of the fittest" in the gym-bro sense. Fitness means reproductive success. A peacock's tail seems absurd until you realize peahens choose mates by tail quality. What matters is leaving offspring.

The power lies in accumulation. Each generation, the filter operates. Beneficial traits spread, harmful ones disappear. Given enough time, this simple process creates staggering complexity. Eyes, wings, brains - all built by selection's patient sieve.
