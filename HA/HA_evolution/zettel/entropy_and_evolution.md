# Entropy and Evolution

## Core Insight
Life accelerates entropy increase by creating ordered structures that dissipate energy more efficiently.

Evolution seems to violate thermodynamics - creating order from chaos. But zoom out: life increases universal entropy faster than non-life. We're entropy's assistants, not its enemies.

A rock sits inert. A mouse metabolizes constantly, radiating heat, increasing entropy. Complex life dissipates energy gradients more efficiently than simple chemistry. Evolution selects for better entropy producers.

This reframes evolution's arrow. Complexity increases not despite entropy, but because of it. Ecosystems are dissipative structures, maintaining order by accelerating disorder. The biosphere is a entropy-maximizing machine.

The deep insight: evolution and thermodynamics align. Both push systems toward states that process energy flows. Life is how the universe efficiently approaches heat death. We're temporary eddies accelerating the cosmic current toward equilibrium.
