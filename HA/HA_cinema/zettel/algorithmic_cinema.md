# Algorithmic Cinema

## Core Insight
When machines dream: AI-generated cinema and the question of creativity without consciousness.

Algorithms now:
- Edit trailers better than humans
- Predict box office from scripts
- Generate believable faces
- Compose emotional music
- Write plausible dialogue
- Create infinite variations

The progression is accelerating:
- Deep fakes making anyone say anything
- Style transfer making any film look like any director
- AI actors who never age, tire, or demand pay
- Procedural stories adapting to viewers
- Personalized films for each watcher

But what is creativity without intention? When AI makes "creative" choices, is it creating or calculating? Does it matter if viewers feel moved?

The uncanny valley applies: AI cinema that's almost-but-not-quite human disturbs more than obviously artificial. We sense something missing - soul? Intent? Genuine emotion? Or just our bias?

Future possibilities terrify/excite:
- Infinite content personalized to each viewer
- Dead actors in new performances forever
- Films that adapt like dreams
- Stories without human creators

Cinema began by mechanizing human vision. Now it's mechanizing human creativity itself. The question isn't whether AI can make films - it's whether films need human makers.
