# Camera

## Core Insight
The mechanical eye that sees differently than human eyes - creating vision that's both less and more than natural sight.

The camera is cinema's first author. Before actors act or directors direct, the camera decides what exists. Its limitations became cinema's language:
- Fixed perspective (unlike wandering eyes)
- Selective focus (unlike total peripheral vision)  
- Frozen time (unlike continuous experience)
- Rectangular frame (unlike circular vision)

These "failures" to replicate human vision became features. The camera showed us how to see differently:
- Slow motion reveals hidden grace
- Fast motion shows invisible patterns
- Macro lenses find universes in drops of water
- Telephoto compresses space into abstraction

The camera evolved from static observer to active participant:
- Hand-held = nervous energy
- Steadicam = ghostly floating
- Crane = godlike overview
- Drone = impossible perspectives

But the camera's deepest power isn't technical. It's psychological. When the camera moves, we move. When it looks, we look. We don't watch through the camera - we become it.

Digital cameras approach human vision's flexibility. But cinema discovered: perfectly realistic vision is boring. The camera's constraints are its poetry.
