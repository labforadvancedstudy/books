# Movement

## Core Insight
The illusion that started everything: still images shown rapidly create the perception of motion.

Cinema begins with a cognitive hack. Show the eye 24 still pictures per second, and the brain sees movement. Not metaphorical movement - actual, smooth, continuous motion where none exists.

This isn't technology. It's biology. The persistence of vision, the phi phenomenon, the beta movement - our brains WANT to see motion. They fill in the gaps between frames with imagined continuity.

Before cinema, movement and time were inseparable. You couldn't capture motion, only suggest it. Cave paintings showed multiple legs to imply running. Photographs froze single moments. But cinema? Cinema captured time itself.

The shock of early audiences wasn't just seeing pictures move. It was seeing the impossible: time bottled and poured back out. The past reanimated. The dead brought to life through light.

Every film since depends on this first miracle - that we see life where there is none, motion where there is stillness, continuity where there are only fragments.
