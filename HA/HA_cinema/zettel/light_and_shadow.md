# Light and Shadow

## Core Insight
Cinema is painting with light - the fundamental medium is not film or pixels, but photons and their absence.

Before cinema told stories, it played with light. The camera obscura, shadow puppets, magic lanterns - humanity's ancient fascination with projected light. Cinema just mechanized this magic.

Light in cinema isn't just illumination. It's:
- Mood (dark = ominous, bright = safe)
- Time (golden hour, harsh noon, blue night)
- Psychology (shadows hiding secrets)
- Focus (what's lit matters)
- Reality level (dreams often overlit or underlit)

Shadow is light's equal partner. What we don't see shapes meaning as much as what we do. Horror lives in shadows. Mystery too. The human face half-lit becomes infinitely more interesting.

Film noir understood: you don't need color when you have contrast. German Expressionism knew: shadows can be characters. Modern cinema forgets: sometimes what you don't show is more powerful.

Digital cinema can create any light imaginable. But the most powerful moments still come from simple sources - a candle, a window, a face emerging from darkness.
