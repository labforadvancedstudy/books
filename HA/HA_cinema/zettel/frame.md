# Frame

## Core Insight
The atomic unit of cinema: a single still image that, in sequence, creates the illusion of life.

A frame is cinema's word, its cell, its heartbeat. 24 times per second (or 30, or 60), a new frame flashes. Each one slightly different. Together: movement, time, life.

But "frame" means more:
- The physical film frame
- The compositional frame (what's included/excluded)
- The narrative frame (context)
- The conceptual frame (how we understand)

The frame is cinema's fundamental limit and power. Unlike theater's open stage or life's peripheral vision, cinema controls absolutely what you see. Every frame is a choice: this, not that. Here, not there. Now, not then.

Framing is power. Close-up = intimacy. Wide shot = context. Dutch angle = unease. The frame shapes meaning before content even registers.

Digital freed us from physical frames but we still think in them. Even VR, promising frameless experience, discovers: without frames, no focus. Without limits, no meaning.

The frame persists because consciousness needs boundaries. Infinite vision is blindness. The frame is cinema's gift: showing by limiting.
