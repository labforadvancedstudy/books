# Game Cinema

## Core Insight
The convergence point: when players become directors of their own cinematic experience.

Games always envied cinema's emotional power. Cinema envied games' interactivity. Now they're merging:
- Cutscenes indistinguishable from films
- Gameplay with cinematic cameras
- Player choices affecting narrative
- Real-time rendering matching pre-rendered
- Performance capture for game actors

But it's not just technical convergence. It's grammatical:
- Quick-time events = interactive editing
- Camera controls = cinematography choices
- Environmental storytelling = mise-en-scène
- Procedural music = dynamic scoring

The unique hybrid powers:
- Agency within authored experience
- Repeated viewings with variations
- Personal pacing (pause, explore, rush)
- Embodiment (you ARE the camera)
- Emergent narrative from systems

Games taught cinema: linear narrative isn't everything. Cinema taught games: emotional engagement needs craft. Together they're creating new form entirely.

The question: when player controls camera, character, and story, are they audience or filmmaker? Answer: both, neither, something new. The consumer-creator hybrid experiencing authored possibility spaces.
