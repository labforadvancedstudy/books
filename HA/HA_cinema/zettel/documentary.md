# Documentary

## Core Insight
Cinema's claim to truth - the paradox of constructing reality while documenting it.

Documentary promises what fiction doesn't: this really happened. But every choice - what to shoot, how to edit, what to include - creates narrative from chaos. Truth through construction.

Documentary modes:
- Observational (fly on wall)
- Participatory (filmmaker visible)
- Poetic (impression over information)
- Expository (argument building)
- Reflexive (questioning itself)
- Performative (truth through experience)

But documentary's "truth" is complicated:
- Cameras change behavior
- Editing creates meaning
- Music manipulates emotion
- Omission shapes story

The ethics: what's owed to subjects? To audience? To "truth"? When does construction become deception? When does observation become exploitation?

Digital blurs further: deepfakes make "seeing believing" obsolete. Found footage fiction mimics documentary grammar. Reality TV scripts "reality." Where's the line?

Yet documentary remains powerful because we NEED to believe some images are true. In a world of infinite fiction, documentary is anchor - even knowing that anchor is also constructed.

The deepest truth: all cinema is documentary of its making. Every film documents actors performing, time passing, light captured. Fiction and documentary aren't opposites but different emphases of same process.
