# Screen

## Core Insight
The luminous surface where private dreams become public visions - cinema's altar and window combined.

The screen is paradox:
- Flat but suggests depth
- Fixed but shows movement
- Material but enables immaterial
- Boundary but feels like portal
- White but contains all colors
- Nothing but holds everything

Screen size matters psychologically:
- Phone = intimate, private
- TV = domestic, casual
- Theater = overwhelming, communal
- IMAX = sublime, religious

The screen is threshold between worlds. We don't look AT it, we look THROUGH it. Good projection makes the screen disappear. We forget the surface, see only the space beyond.

But screens multiply and mutate:
- CRT's hypnotic glow
- LCD's crystalline clarity
- LED walls that ARE the image
- VR that surrounds completely

Each screen type creates different relationships. Theater screens demand pilgrimage. Home screens invite casual viewing. Phone screens make cinema portable, personal. The medium shapes the message.

The dream: screenless cinema. Direct neural projection. But maybe we need the frame, the boundary, the separation. The screen protects us from total immersion while enabling deep engagement.
