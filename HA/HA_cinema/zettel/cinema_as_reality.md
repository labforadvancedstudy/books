# Cinema as Reality

## Core Insight
The ultimate convergence: when mediated experience becomes indistinguishable from direct experience.

We're approaching the event horizon where cinema stops being representation and becomes reality itself:
- Deepfakes making any video possible
- VR creating full sensory worlds
- AR overlaying fiction on reality
- Neural interfaces bypassing senses entirely

But deeper: maybe cinema was always reality. Consider:
- Most knowledge comes from screens
- Most emotions triggered by media
- Most memories include films/shows
- Most dreams use cinematic grammar

We live in hybrid reality - part direct experience, part mediated. The ratio shifts toward mediation. Children know fictional characters better than neighbors. Adults process trauma through film references. We understand ourselves through cinematic narratives.

The simulation hypothesis asks: what if reality is computed? But we know reality is mediated. We experience everything through biological cameras (eyes), edited by attention, colored by emotion, stored as narrative.

Cinema didn't invent mediation - it externalized it. Made visible what consciousness always did: select, frame, edit, narrativize. 

The end point isn't cinema becoming perfectly realistic. It's recognizing reality was always cinematic. We're cameras recording, editors cutting, projectors sharing. Existence is cinema. Cinema is existence recognizing itself.
