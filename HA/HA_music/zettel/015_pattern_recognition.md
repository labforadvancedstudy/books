## Core Insight
Music is a game between expectation and surprise - the brain constantly predicts what comes next.

## Content
Our brains are prediction machines, and music exploits this beautifully. We learn patterns - rhythmic, melodic, harmonic - and derive pleasure from both fulfilled and cleverly violated expectations.

A V chord creates tension because we've learned it "wants" to resolve to I. Syncopation excites because it disrupts expected beats. Jazz musicians play with these expectations explicitly. Pop music often fulfills them completely. Both can create profound satisfaction through different pattern strategies.

This isn't cultural - it's computational. The brain rewards itself for successful pattern detection and mild prediction errors. Music is pattern recognition training disguised as entertainment.
