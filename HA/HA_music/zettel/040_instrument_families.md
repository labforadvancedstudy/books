## Core Insight
Instruments evolved to fill acoustic niches - each family exploits different physical principles to colonize unique sonic territories.

## Content
Strings use tension and length to control pitch. Winds use air column resonance. Percussion uses material properties and geometry. Each principle creates characteristic timbres and capabilities.

But instruments also evolved culturally to fill ensemble niches. The violin family spans from double bass to violin, covering the human vocal range. Brass instruments developed valves to fill harmonic gaps. Electronic instruments exploded these limitations, creating sounds impossible in nature.

Each innovation opened new musical possibilities, which drove further innovation. The instrument shapes the music shapes the culture shapes the instrument.
