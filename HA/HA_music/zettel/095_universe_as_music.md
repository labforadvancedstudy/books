## Core Insight
Perhaps the universe isn't like music - perhaps the universe IS music, and matter is just very slow songs.

## Content
Superstring theory proposes reality's fundamental constituents are vibrating strings. Orbital mechanics follows harmonic ratios. Atoms vibrate. DNA has rhythm. Brainwaves oscillate. Pulsars keep time better than atomic clocks.

What if consciousness evolved to perceive music because reality itself is musical? Not metaphorically, but literally - vibration and resonance as the fundamental operations of existence. Matter as standing waves. Forces as phase relationships. Time as tempo.

Ancient traditions intuited this - "Om" as the universe's fundamental frequency, Pythagorean music of the spheres, Aboriginal songlines creating landscape. Modern physics stumbles toward the same conclusion from different directions.

We don't project music onto a silent universe. We evolved ears to hear what was always there - the universe singing itself into existence.
