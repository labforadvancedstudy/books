## Core Insight
Silence isn't the absence of music - it's the canvas on which music exists, the quantum vacuum from which sound emerges.

## Content
John Cage's 4'33" revealed there is no true silence - only unintended sound. In an anechoic chamber, we hear our heartbeat and nervous system. Silence is relative, contextual, impossible.

Yet silence shapes music as much as sound. The pause before resolution creates tension. The rest makes the note meaningful. Japanese ma (間) - the pregnant emptiness between sounds - is as important as the sounds themselves.

Silence might be music's connection to the void - the fundamental ground of being from which all vibration arises. Every piece of music emerges from silence and returns to it. In beginning was silence, then the Word, then the Song.
