## Core Insight
Music bypasses rational thought to directly modulate emotional states - it's emotional telepathy through sound.

## Content
When we hear music, mirror neuron systems activate as if we were producing those sounds ourselves. Slow tempos literally slow our heart rates. Minor keys activate brain regions associated with sadness, even in listeners who've never learned this cultural association.

This isn't metaphorical - it's physiological. Music synchronizes neural oscillations across multiple brains. A concert audience becomes a single, coordinated emotional organism. This might explain music's power in ritual, religion, and war - it creates shared emotional states that bypass individual resistance.

We don't just hear emotion in music; we become it.
