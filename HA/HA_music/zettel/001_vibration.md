## Core Insight
Everything that makes sound vibrates. Music begins with motion.

## Content
When something moves back and forth repeatedly, it creates waves in the air. These waves are what we call sound. A guitar string vibrates, a drum head vibrates, vocal cords vibrate. Even silence is just the absence of these vibrations reaching our ears.

The speed of vibration determines pitch - faster vibrations make higher sounds, slower vibrations make lower sounds. This is the most fundamental truth of music: it is organized vibration.
