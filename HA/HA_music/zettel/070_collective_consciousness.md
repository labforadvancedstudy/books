## Core Insight
Music is technology for creating shared consciousness - multiple minds temporarily merging into unified experience.

## Content
At concerts, raves, religious ceremonies, protests - music synchronizes brains into collective states. EEG studies show neural oscillations aligning across listeners. Heart rates synchronize. Breathing patterns merge. Individual consciousness boundaries dissolve.

This isn't metaphor - it's measurable neuroscience. Music might be humanity's oldest technology for creating group minds. Before language complexified enough for abstract coordination, rhythm and melody created shared intentionality.

Modern electronic music pushes this further - using precise frequencies, repetitive patterns, and massive sound systems to induce collective altered states. The dancefloor becomes a single organism. Music reveals consciousness isn't inherently individual - it's a field that can be shaped, shared, merged.
