## Core Insight
Resonance is the universe's way of saying "yes" - when frequencies match, energy flows freely and amplifies.

## Content
Every object has natural frequencies at which it "wants" to vibrate. Strike a tuning fork, and another fork of the same frequency will start singing in sympathy. This is resonance - frequency matching creating energy transfer and amplification.

Instruments are resonance machines. A violin body resonates with string vibrations, amplifying and coloring the sound. A flute is a resonant air column. Even our bodies resonate - chest voice, head voice, the sympathetic vibrations we feel at concerts.

Resonance explains why certain intervals sound good together - when frequency ratios are simple (2:1, 3:2), waveforms align regularly, creating constructive interference. Dissonance occurs when waves fight each other. Harmony is physics made audible.
