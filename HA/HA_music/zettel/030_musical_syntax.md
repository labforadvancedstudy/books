## Core Insight
Music has grammar - not of words but of expectations, tensions, and resolutions.

## Content
Like language, music operates through hierarchical structures. Notes form motifs, motifs form phrases, phrases form sections, sections form movements. Each level has its own rules and patterns.

But unlike language, musical syntax is felt rather than decoded. We don't need to know that a dominant seventh chord contains a tritone to feel its tension. We don't need to understand sonata form to experience the satisfaction of a recapitulation.

This implicit knowledge suggests musical syntax might be more fundamental than linguistic syntax - a proto-grammar that shaped how we process any sequential information.
