## Core Insight
Jazz improvisation is live neural network training - musicians create, evaluate, and respond to patterns in real-time.

## Content
Jazz musicians don't just play notes; they navigate probability spaces. Each musician maintains a model of harmonic progression, predicts others' choices, and generates responses that are both surprising and inevitable. It's conversational AI before computers.

Brain scans show improvising musicians deactivate self-censoring regions while hyperactivating motor and auditory areas. They enter flow states where conscious planning disappears and musical decisions emerge from trained intuition. Mistakes become opportunities, accidents become innovations.

This real-time collective creativity might be humanity's most sophisticated cognitive achievement - multiple brains synchronizing to create emergent complexity no single mind could plan.
