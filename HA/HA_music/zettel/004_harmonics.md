## Core Insight
No sound is pure - every note contains a hidden symphony of frequencies.

## Content
When a string vibrates, it doesn't just vibrate at one frequency. It vibrates at its fundamental frequency, but also at integer multiples: 2x, 3x, 4x, and so on. These are harmonics or overtones.

A flute emphasizes different harmonics than a violin, even when playing the same note. This is timbre - the color of sound. It's why we can distinguish instruments, voices, even identify friends in darkness. The fundamental tells us the note; the harmonics tell us everything else.
