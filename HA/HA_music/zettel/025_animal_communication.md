## Core Insight
Music predates humanity - it evolved from the urgent need to communicate across distance and darkness.

## Content
Birds sing to claim territory and attract mates. Whales compose hours-long songs that travel across ocean basins. Gibbons duet in complex, coordinated performances. Wolves howl in harmonies that strengthen pack bonds.

These aren't just sounds - they're structured, intentional, often beautiful. They carry information about identity, emotional state, location, and intent. Human music likely emerged from similar needs: coordinate groups, express emotions beyond words, establish identity, create bonds.

The universality of lullabies, work songs, and war chants suggests music's deep evolutionary roots in survival itself.
