# Symbols and Meaning

## Core Insight
A symbol gains meaning only through agreed interpretation - the letter 'A' is just squiggles until we collectively decide it represents a sound or concept.

In the beginning, there were marks. A child draws a circle and says "sun." An ancient human carves a notch meaning "one day passed." These marks aren't the things themselves - they *point to* the things. This pointing, this reference, is the birth of all language.

Programming languages are humanity's attempt to create symbols so precise that even a machine can't misinterpret them. Where human language thrives on ambiguity and poetry, programming languages demand absolute clarity. 

```
x = 5
```

Here, 'x' is a symbol. '5' is a symbol. '=' is a symbol. Their meaning? Whatever we've agreed they mean in this language's universe. The computer doesn't know 'x' any more than a paper knows the ink on it. But through layers of interpretation, these symbols become action.

The profound mystery: How do arbitrary symbols become meaningful? In human language, through shared experience and culture. In programming languages, through formal definitions and ultimately, transistors flipping states.

Every variable name is an act of creation - bringing a new symbol into existence and binding it to meaning.
