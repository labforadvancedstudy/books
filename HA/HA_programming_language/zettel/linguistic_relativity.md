# Linguistic Relativity

## Core Insight
The programming language you use doesn't just express your solution - it shapes what solutions you can even conceive of.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis for human languages is controversial. But for programming languages? It's demonstrably true. Language shapes thought.

A Java programmer faced with a problem thinks: "What objects do I need? What are their relationships?" The language pushes toward object-oriented decomposition.

A Haskell programmer thinks: "What transformations do I need? How do I compose them?" The language pushes toward functional composition.

A Prolog programmer thinks: "What facts and rules define this domain?" The language pushes toward logical relations.

Consider list processing:

```java
// Java: Imperative mutation
List<Integer> doubled = new ArrayList<>();
for (int x : numbers) {
    doubled.add(x * 2);
}
```

```haskell
-- Haskell: Functional transformation
doubled = map (*2) numbers
```

```prolog
% Prolog: Logical relation
double_list([], []).
double_list([H|T], [H2|T2]) :- 
    H2 is H * 2, 
    double_list(T, T2).
```

Same problem, three universes of thought. The Java programmer might never think of the problem as establishing a logical relation. The Prolog programmer might never think of it as mapping a function.

More profound: some concepts don't translate. Try explaining monads to a C programmer. Try explaining pointer arithmetic to a Python programmer. It's not just syntax - it's entire mental models that the language makes natural or alien.

The terrifying implication: what thoughts are we not thinking because our languages can't express them? What problems remain unsolved because their natural solution requires a language not yet invented?
