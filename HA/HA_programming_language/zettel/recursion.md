# Recursion

## Core Insight
Recursion is a function calling itself - but more profoundly, it's how we encode infinity in finite space, making the impossible computable.

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion. This joke captures the essence: recursion is self-reference in action.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Look closely. The function `factorial` contains a call to `factorial`. It defines itself in terms of itself. This should be impossible - like defining "apple" as "a fruit that is an apple." Yet it works.

The secret: the base case. `if n <= 1: return 1`. Without this, recursion becomes infinite regress. With it, recursion becomes a powerful way to express naturally recursive problems.

But recursion is more than a programming technique - it's a fundamental pattern in nature and thought:
- Trees are recursive: branches have branches
- Fractals are recursive: patterns within patterns
- Language is recursive: sentences contain sentences
- Consciousness is recursive: thinking about thinking

The profound insight: recursion lets finite programs process infinite structures. A tiny recursive function can traverse trees of any size, parse languages of any complexity, compute to any depth.

Iteration is recursion's mundane cousin. Any loop can be written recursively. Any recursion can be written as a loop (with a stack). But recursion expresses the WHAT. Loops express the HOW.
