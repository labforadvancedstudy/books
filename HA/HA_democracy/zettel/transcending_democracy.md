# Transcending Democracy

## Core Insight
Democracy may be transitional technology - necessary step between autocracy and whatever comes next.

Just as democracy transcended monarchy, something will transcend democracy. Not regression to autocracy but progression to systems we can't yet imagine. Possibilities: AI governance, market-based policy, cellular automata societies, hivemind collectives, voluntary fractal communities. Each sounds dystopian because we evaluate through democratic lens.

The transcendence won't come through reform but phase transition - like water to steam. Democracy emerged when printing enabled mass literacy. Next phase might emerge from AI, brain-computer interfaces, or technologies not yet invented. Democracy as over-technology means it carries seeds of its own transcendence - pushing information processing until new forms become possible and necessary.
