# Information Aggregation

## Core Insight
Democracy's core challenge - combining millions of partial perspectives into coherent decisions.

Democracy assumes collective wisdom: many minds together know more than any individual. But aggregating information isn't simple addition. Votes compress complex preferences into binary choices. Representatives sample constituent opinion sporadically. Media filters and amplifies selectively. Each layer of aggregation loses signal, adds noise.

Markets aggregate information through prices, evolution through survival. Democracy uses voting - a primitive mechanism that predates information theory. We designed the aggregation system before understanding information, like building computers before discovering logic gates. The infrastructure problem: democracy needs sophisticated information processing but uses stone-age tools.
