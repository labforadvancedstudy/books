# Prerequisites Missing

## Core Insight
Democracy's chronic failures stem from implementing the system before developing necessary supporting technologies.

Democracy assumes: informed citizens, rational discourse, accountable representatives, fast feedback, shared truth. None existed when democracy was invented. Mass literacy came millennia later. Telecommunications centuries after that. Fact-checking, data analysis, bureaucratic capacity - all post-hoc additions to patch a broken system.

It's like installing software requiring 16GB RAM on a system with 16KB. The program runs, badly, corrupting everything. We blame the users (citizens) or developers (founders) but the real problem is architectural mismatch. Democracy needs information-age infrastructure but runs on stone-age hardware. Every failure mode traces to missing prerequisites.
