# Campaign Rally

## Core Insight
Mass democracy's substitute for deliberation - one-way broadcast replacing two-way dialogue.

Campaign rallies emerged when democracy scaled beyond conversation. Candidates perform for crowds who cannot respond except through cheers or boos. Information flows unidirectionally: speaker to audience, no feedback loop. This isn't dialogue degraded, it's a different technology entirely - broadcast media grafted onto democratic ideals.

The rally optimizes for emotional resonance over information transfer. Complex policy becomes soundbites, nuance dies in stadiums. We pretend this helps voters choose, but it's really about tribal bonding and energy harvesting. Democracy's over-technology problem manifest: we need informed choice but use tools designed for war cries.
