# Participation Principle

## Core Insight
Democracy's axiom - those affected by decisions should participate in making them. Simple idea, impossible implementation.

The principle seems self-evident: people should control their own fates. But defining "affected" and "participate" breaks everything. Everyone is affected by everything in interconnected societies. Full participation is impossible at scale. We approximate through citizenship and voting, but these are crude proxies.

Children affected but can't vote. Foreigners affected by domestic policies can't participate. Future generations affected most can't influence decisions. The participation principle is democracy's false foundation - a beautiful ideal that can't be operationalized. We implement shadows of it through arbitrary boundaries (citizenship, age, territory) that violate the principle they supposedly serve.
