# Bureaucratic Machinery

## Core Insight
Democracy's hidden infrastructure - the permanent apparatus that actually runs things while elections provide theater.

Bureaucracy is democracy's necessary evil: professional administrators who implement what politicians decide. But bureaucrats have their own interests, information advantages, staying power. They shape policy through implementation, resist changes through inertia, accumulate power through expertise. The permanent government often matters more than the temporary elected one.

This wasn't planned - bureaucracy evolved to handle complexity democracy creates. Laws need enforcement, programs need management, citizens need services. Democracy's over-technology problem compounds: we need massive bureaucracy because democratic decision-making is too crude for actual governance. The machinery runs the machine.
