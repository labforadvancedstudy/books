# Separation of Powers

## Core Insight
Democracy's hack for preventing tyranny - divide power so it fights itself, creating stability through conflict.

Montesquieu's insight: concentrated power corrupts, so fragment it. Executive, legislative, judicial branches check each other, creating gridlock as feature not bug. This assumes competition prevents dominance, that ambition counteracts ambition. Sometimes works, often doesn't - branches collude, one dominates, or system paralyzes.

Separation of powers is pre-cybernetic engineering: using mechanical opposition instead of feedback loops. We balance power through conflict rather than information flow. It's democracy's immune system, but primitive - like using fever to fight all infections. Over-technology again: implementing checks and balances before understanding control theory.
