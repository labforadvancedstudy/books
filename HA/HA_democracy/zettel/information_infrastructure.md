# Information Infrastructure

## Core Insight
Democracy's retroactively built nervous system - the channels for gathering, processing, and distributing information.

Democracy needs massive information flow: citizen preferences upward, policy information downward, feedback loops everywhere. Pre-modern societies had none of this. No mass media, telecommunications, data processing. Democracy ran on gossip and pamphlets, like running a corporation on cave paintings.

Modern information infrastructure (journalism, polling, internet, databases) evolved to fill democracy's needs, but piecemeal and poorly. Each component optimizes locally - media for attention, polls for prediction, internet for engagement. Nobody designed the system holistically. We're retrofitting democracy with information technology, but the connections are mismatched, creating new pathologies while solving old ones.
