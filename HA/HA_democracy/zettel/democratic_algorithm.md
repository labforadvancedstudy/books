# Democratic Algorithm

## Core Insight
Democracy reduced to its computational essence - an algorithm for converting individual preferences into collective decisions.

Strip away ideology and democracy is algorithm:
1. Collect preferences from population subset (citizens)
2. Aggregate using counting rules (majority, plurality, etc.)
3. Select leaders/policies based on aggregation
4. Implement with bureaucratic machinery
5. Loop every N years

The algorithm has known bugs: Arrow's paradox, strategic voting, information loss, feedback delay. But we run it anyway because alternative algorithms (dictatorship, oligarchy, technocracy) have worse failure modes. Democracy isn't optimal algorithm - it's least-bad algorithm we've discovered for governance at scale.
