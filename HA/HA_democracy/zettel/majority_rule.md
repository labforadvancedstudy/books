# Majority Rule

## Core Insight
Democracy's simplest algorithm - count votes, biggest number wins. Elegant, brutal, often wrong.

Majority rule seems obvious: more support = better choice. But Arrow's theorem proved no voting system can satisfy basic fairness criteria. Condorcet showed majorities can prefer A>B>C>A in cycles. The algorithm we treat as democracy's foundation is mathematically broken for any interesting decision.

Yet it persists because alternatives are worse or incomprehensible. Minority rule? Expertise-weighted voting? Random selection? Majority rule isn't optimal, it's comprehensible. Like democracy itself, it's over-technology - we use it before developing better algorithms because humans understand "most votes wins" even when it produces incoherent results.
