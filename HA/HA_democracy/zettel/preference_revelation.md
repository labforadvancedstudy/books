# Preference Revelation

## Core Insight
Democracy's measurement problem - how to extract true preferences when revealing them has consequences.

Voting isn't just counting existing preferences, it's creating them. Strategic voting, preference falsification, cascade effects all distort the signal. People vote for electable candidates not favorites, hide unpopular views, conform to perceived majorities. The measurement changes the measured - democracy's uncertainty principle.

Mechanism design tries to create "incentive-compatible" systems where truth-telling is optimal. But Arrow proved this impossible for voting. We want honest preferences but reward strategic behavior. Democracy needs accurate preference data but uses mechanisms that incentivize lying. Another over-technology problem: implementing preference aggregation before solving preference revelation.
