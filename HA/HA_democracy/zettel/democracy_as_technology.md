# Democracy as Technology

## Core Insight
Democracy isn't a philosophy but a technology - and we deployed it 2000 years before developing its prerequisites.

Like finding a smartphone in ancient Rome, democracy appeared before its supporting infrastructure. It needs: mass literacy, telecommunications, information processing, bureaucratic capacity, economic surplus, shared identity. Greeks and Romans had none of these at scale, nor did anyone until the 20th century.

We treat democracy's failures as moral failings, but they're engineering failures. It's not that people are too selfish or stupid for democracy - it's that democracy requires technological prerequisites we're still developing. Journalism, education, bureaucracy, information systems all evolved to support democracy retroactively. We're debugging a system deployed prematurely, patching missing dependencies as we discover them.
