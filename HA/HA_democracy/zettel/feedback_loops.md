# Feedback Loops

## Core Insight
Democracy's missing control system - feedback between decisions and outcomes arrives too late, too distorted.

Functioning systems need rapid, accurate feedback. Democracy's feedback loops are glacial: elections every 2-6 years, policy effects taking decades, voters judging on feels not facts. By the time feedback arrives, the context has changed, the decision-makers have moved on, the lessons are mislearned.

Compare market feedback (prices adjust instantly) or evolutionary feedback (death is immediate). Democracy separates decision from consequence, making learning nearly impossible. We vote on promises, judge on vibes, rarely connect specific policies to specific outcomes. It's flying blind with occasional, unreliable instruments. Over-technology crystallized: a decision system without functioning feedback.
