# Democracy Paradox

## Core Insight
Democracy contains its own negation - the democratic right to end democracy, the majority's power to oppress minorities.

Democracy's deepest contradiction: if people truly rule, they can vote to stop ruling. Historic examples abound - democratic elections producing autocrats, majorities voting away minority rights, populists dismantling democratic institutions. The paradox is irreducible: limiting democracy to preserve democracy makes it non-democratic.

This isn't implementation failure but logical necessity. Any system granting ultimate power to the people includes power to destroy the system. Constitutional constraints, judicial review, rights protections all limit democracy to save it - creating elaborate fictions about "true" democracy versus mob rule. But philosophically there's no difference: democracy includes its own termination clause.
