# Voting Act

## Core Insight
The physical act of casting a ballot - the most visible yet least powerful component of democracy.

Individual citizens marking preferences on paper or electronic systems, depositing them in designated containers. The ritual performance of democratic participation that creates legitimacy through visibility rather than actual power transfer. Each vote a tiny signal in a vast information-processing system that was invented before we understood information theory.

Observable behaviors: standing in line, entering booth, marking ballot, submitting choice. The ceremony masks the computational complexity beneath - how do millions of individual preferences aggregate into collective decision? The act persists because it's comprehensible, even when the system it feeds is not.
