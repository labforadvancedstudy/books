# Deliberation

## Core Insight
Democracy's impossible ideal - rational discourse producing consensus. Breaks at scale, distorts under pressure.

Deliberation assumes people can discuss, reason, and converge on truth or compromise. Habermas's "ideal speech situation" - no coercion, equal voice, commitment to logic. This might work in seminar rooms, fails in mass society. Time limits, attention spans, bad faith actors, cascade effects all corrupt the process.

Yet deliberation remains democracy's theoretical foundation. We design institutions (parliaments, courts, committees) as if good-faith reasoning could overcome interest and passion. The infrastructure for quality deliberation - education, media, time to think - came centuries after democratic voting. Cart before horse, interface before implementation.
