# Bandwidth Democracy

## Core Insight
Democracy is fundamentally limited by information bandwidth - between citizens, representatives, and institutions.

Traditional democracy operates at conversation speed: speeches, debates, written laws. But modern society generates data at gigabit rates. The bandwidth mismatch is catastrophic. Representatives can't process constituent feedback. Citizens can't understand policy complexity. Institutions can't respond to rapid change. We're governing information-age societies with stone-age bandwidth.

Digital technology promises solutions but creates new problems. Information overload replaces information scarcity. Viral lies spread faster than complex truths. Engagement algorithms optimize for outrage not understanding. Expanding bandwidth without improving processing just accelerates dysfunction. Democracy needs not just more bandwidth but better protocols.
