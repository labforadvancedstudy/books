# Digital Democracy

## Core Insight
Technology offers democracy's first major upgrade in centuries - but digital tools amplify pathologies alongside capabilities.

Digital democracy promises: continuous feedback, unlimited bandwidth, perfect information, frictionless participation. Estonia shows glimpses: online voting, digital identity, algorithmic governance. But digital also enables: surveillance states, echo chambers, manipulation at scale, system fragility.

The core challenge: democracy's problems aren't just technical but fundamental. Digital tools can't fix voting paradoxes, just make them compute faster. Can't solve preference aggregation, just collect more confused data. Can't create informed citizens, just overwhelm them efficiently. Digital democracy is democracy at higher clock speed - same bugs, faster execution.
