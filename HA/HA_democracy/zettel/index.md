# Democracy Zettelkasten Index

## Core Insight: Democracy as Over-Technology

Democracy is a sophisticated governance technology discovered 2,500 years before its prerequisites (mass literacy, instant communication, bureaucratic machinery) existed. We're still building the infrastructure retroactively.

## L1-L2: Observable Phenomena
- [[voting_act]] - The ritual of marking paper
- [[ballot_box]] - Stone age database technology
- [[town_meeting]] - Democracy at human scale
- [[campaign_rally]] - Mass broadcast, zero information

## L3: Patterns
- [[majority_rule]] - Simple algorithm, complex failures
- [[representation]] - Compression with 99.9% data loss
- [[deliberation]] - Impossible ideal of rational discourse
- [[consensus_building]] - Works until it doesn't

## L4: Mechanics
- [[information_aggregation]] - Summing ignorance
- [[preference_revelation]] - Quantum measurement problem
- [[collective_choice]] - The fiction of group will
- [[voting_paradoxes]] - Mathematical proofs of failure

## L5: Systems
- [[separation_powers]] - Conflict as control
- [[electoral_systems]] - Different ways to distort
- [[bureaucratic_machinery]] - The real government
- [[feedback_loops]] - Too slow to matter

## L6: Technology View
- [[democracy_as_technology]] - Premature optimization
- [[prerequisites_missing]] - What wasn't ready
- [[information_infrastructure]] - Still being built
- [[premature_implementation]] - Alpha software in production

## L7: Universal Principles
- [[participation_principle]] - Beautiful impossibility
- [[equality_axiom]] - Noble lie
- [[legitimacy_source]] - Circular reasoning
- [[democratic_algorithm]] - Simple code, impossible execution

## L8: Computational Layer
- [[computational_limits]] - NP-complete on wetware
- [[bandwidth_democracy]] - Gigabit needs, telegraph reality
- [[collective_intelligence]] - Why groups become dumber
- [[digital_democracy]] - Same problems, new substrate

## L9: Ultimate Questions
- [[democracy_paradox]] - Must destroy itself to save itself
- [[impossibility_theorems]] - Mathematically proven failures
- [[future_democracy]] - What comes after failure?
- [[transcending_democracy]] - Beyond voting

Each zettel is an atomic insight that stands alone while connecting to the greater web of democratic impossibility. Together they form a comprehensive map of humanity's most ambitious technological failure.

Key Insight: Democracy isn't broken - it was never possible to begin with. We're running future software on past hardware using present-day duct tape.
