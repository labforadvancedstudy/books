# Computational Limits

## Core Insight
Democracy hits fundamental computational boundaries - processing millions of preferences exceeds any system's capacity.

Democracy is NP-complete problem: optimal preference aggregation requires comparing all possible outcomes across all citizens. Computationally impossible. We use heuristics (voting) that give approximate answers, but approximation error compounds. Adding more compute doesn't help - the problem space explodes faster than processing power.

Human brains evolved for 150-person tribes, not 150-million nations. Representative democracy tries to compress computation, but creates new problems: agent-principal misalignment, information bottlenecks, strategic complexity. We're running society-scale algorithms on stone-age wetware. Democracy's failures aren't moral but computational - asking systems to process information beyond their theoretical limits.
