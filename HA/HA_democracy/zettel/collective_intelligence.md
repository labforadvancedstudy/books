# Collective Intelligence

## Core Insight
Democracy assumes groups can be smarter than individuals - but usually makes them dumber through bad aggregation.

Markets demonstrate collective intelligence: prices incorporate distributed information no individual possesses. Science shows it: peer review and replication create knowledge beyond any researcher. But democratic voting often produces collective stupidity: cascades, polarization, demagogue selection.

The difference is mechanism design. Markets use price signals, science uses empirical tests. Democracy uses counting - a primitive aggregation that loses information and amplifies bias. True collective intelligence requires: diverse inputs, decentralized processing, error correction, learning mechanisms. Democracy has diverse inputs but fails the rest. We could design better collective intelligence systems, but path dependence locks us into voting.
