# Impossibility Theorems

## Core Insight
Mathematical proofs that democracy's goals are logically impossible - not hard or impractical but mathematically forbidden.

Arrow's theorem: no voting system can be rational, democratic, and decisive. Gibbard-Satterthwaite: strategic voting is unavoidable. McKelvey chaos: majority rule produces arbitrary outcomes. Sen's paradox: individual liberty conflicts with collective choice. These aren't engineering challenges but logical limits - like perpetual motion or faster-than-light travel.

Democracy persists despite impossibility because theorems assume ideals we can relax. Don't need perfect rationality, just adequate decisions. Don't need strategy-proofness, just acceptable gaming. Don't need coherent collective will, just stable governance. Democracy works by accepting impossibility and optimizing within constraints - but we pretend otherwise.
