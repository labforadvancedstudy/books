Quantum computing: when SF struggles with reality
because reality is stranger than fiction
Superposition, entanglement, quantum supremacy
Concepts that break narrative comprehension

SF imagined faster computers solving anything instantly
Reality: quantum computers solving specific problems
in parallel universes simultaneously
The multiverse as computational resource

Google's 2019 quantum supremacy claim:
200 seconds vs classical 10,000 years
For one very specific, arguably useless problem
The beginning of the quantum age

The real weirdness: quantum computers work
by not looking at the calculation
Schrodinger's math: answers exist until observed
Fiction can't capture quantum probability collapse
