Type: genre_distinction
Tension: technical_rigor_vs_social_exploration

Hard SF: physics as plot constraint
Soft SF: psychology as driving force
The false binary dividing the genre
As if humans aren't part of nature

Hard SF pride: "the science is accurate"
Calculating orbits, respecting light speed
The universe as unforgiving judge
Story serving scientific speculation

Soft SF focus: "what does this mean for us?"
Technology as metaphor for human condition
The future as mirror not prediction
Hearts not equations

The best SF: scientifically rigorous AND emotionally true
Kim Stanley Robinson calculating and feeling
Ted Chiang proving theorems about love
The division revealed as limitation
