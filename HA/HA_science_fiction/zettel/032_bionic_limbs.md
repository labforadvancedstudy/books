"We can rebuild him. We have the technology."
The Six Million Dollar Man's promise from 1974
Bionic limbs stronger, faster, better than biological
The cyborg dream of enhancement not just replacement

Reality: neural-controlled prosthetics reading mind signals
DARPA's Luke Arm giving sensation back
Osseointegration fusing metal to bone
The boundary between flesh and machine dissolving

SF's oversimplification: plug and play bodies
Reality's complexity: phantom pain, neural rewiring
The brain's desperate attempts to map missing limbs
Neuroplasticity as both problem and solution

The ethical shift: from restoration to enhancement
When prosthetics outperform biology
The Pistorius problem: too good for the Olympics?
Augmentation as the new normal
