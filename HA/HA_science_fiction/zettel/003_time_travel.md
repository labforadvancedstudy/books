# Time Travel

## Core Insight
The fundamental SF concept that breaks causality. From Wells to Einstein, from paradoxes to closed timelike curves. Time travel isn't about when - it's about the nature of time itself.

## Body
H.G. Wells gave us the machine, but physics gave us the possibility. General relativity doesn't forbid time travel - it practically invites it. Rotating black holes, cosmic strings, Alcubierre drives warping spacetime. The universe's speed limit creates its own loopholes.

The grandfather paradox dissolves in many-worlds interpretation. You don't change your past - you create a new timeline. Every quantum event branches reality. Time travel just lets you choose which branch to ride. Primer got it right: loops within loops, causality as gordian knot.

But the real insight? We're all time travelers moving forward at one second per second. Relativity proves time isn't universal - GPS satellites age faster than us. Twin paradox isn't paradox, it's proven fact. Time dilation is time travel we've already achieved.

Science fiction explored every permutation: fixed timeline (12 Monkeys), mutable timeline (Back to the Future), bootstrap paradox (Predestination). Each reveals something true about causality, free will, determinism. The question isn't whether time travel is possible - it's whether the universe has safety mechanisms.

Maybe that's why we haven't met time travelers. Not because it's impossible, but because the universe self-corrects. Chronology protection conjecture: physics conspires to prevent paradoxes. Time travel might be the universe's error-handling routine.
