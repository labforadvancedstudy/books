John W. Campbell's Astounding Stories (1937-1971) forged science fiction's golden age.
His formula: rigorous science + competent heroes + problems solved by intelligence = cultural phenomenon.

Campbell demanded stories where science was co-protagonist, not decoration.
He nurtured Asimov (Foundation), Heinlein (Future History), van Vogt (Null-A) - titans born from his editorial vision.
The era's belief: science and reason would solve everything, from poverty to death itself.
Space wasn't final frontier but manifest destiny - cowboys with slide rules.

Golden Age innovations:
- Psychohistory: predicting mass behavior mathematically (prefigured Big Data)
- Three Laws of Robotics: AI ethics before computers existed
- Generation ships: serious treatment of interstellar travel
- Galactic empires: scaling human drama to cosmic size

Stories were thought experiments: "What if telepathy was real but rare?"
Engineer heroes solved problems with equations, not ray guns.
Women were largely absent except as rewards - the era's blind spot.
Atomic optimism: nuclear power would be too cheap to meter.

The aesthetic: chrome spaceships, food pills, flying cars, rational governance.
Post-WWII America projected into space - suburban values among stars.
Created expectations that still haunt us: where's my jetpack?
But also inspired actual scientists: NASA was built by golden age readers.
