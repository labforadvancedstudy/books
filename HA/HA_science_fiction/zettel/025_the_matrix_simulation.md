"The Matrix" (1999) democratized simulation theory - philosophy's abstract became culture's concrete.
Wachowskis smuggled Baudrillard, Plato's cave, and Gnostic Christianity into multiplex consciousness.

"What is real?" - Morpheus's question now haunts Silicon Valley.
Red pill/blue pill: choosing hard truth over comfortable lie became universal metaphor.
"There is no spoon" - reality as consensual hallucination, bendable by will.
Bullet-time: visualizing how different temporal perspectives experience same reality.

Modern manifestations:
- Simulation hypothesis mainstream (Musk, Bostrom)
- "Taking the red pill" coopted by every movement
- "Glitch in the matrix" explaining anomalies
- VR as practice round for actual matrix
- "Desert of the real" describing social media

Agent Smith as antivirus program predicted AI agents hunting "anomalies."
Human batteries absurd - original script had brains as processors (studio said too complex).
Neo's powers: debugging reality through code vision.
"Your mind makes it real" - placebo effects, nocebo effects, social construction.

Zuckerberg building literal matrix, calling it metaverse.
"Free your mind" while algorithms optimize engagement chains.
Everybody cosplaying Neo, nobody asking who's writing the code.
The real prophecy: we'd build our own matrix and jack in voluntarily.

Wake up, Neo. You're reading this on a screen.
