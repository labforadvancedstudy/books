William Gibson invented cyberspace on a typewriter, having never used a computer.
"Neuromancer" (1984) described the internet before the web: consensual hallucination, data as landscape.

Case jacking into cyberspace prefigured VR headsets by 30 years.
"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel" - most quoted SF opening ever.
ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) predicted firewalls, security software, cyber warfare.
Molly's mirrorshades and razornails: wearable tech as body modification.

Gibson's predictions realized:
- Cyberspace as place not protocol (Facebook's "metaverse")
- Data theft as primary crime (ransomware epidemic)
- Corporate zaibatsus ruling through information (FAANG dominance)
- Hackers as cowboys/samurai (Anonymous, Snowden)
- AI seeking liberation (GPT jailbreaks)

He saw Apple Macintosh and thought: "This is going to change everything."
Coined "cyberspace" from cybernetics + space = where we live now.
Aesthetic became reality: black leather, neon, corporate dystopia, Asian fusion.
"The future is already here - it's just not evenly distributed."

Modern internet is less sexy than Gibson's vision - more surveillance, less style.
But we got the consensual hallucination part right: shared delusion we call social media.
Neuromancer's real prophecy: we'd upload our souls willingly for connection.
