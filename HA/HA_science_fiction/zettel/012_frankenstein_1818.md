Mary Shelley's masterpiece birthed science fiction by asking: what happens when humanity plays god?
Written during the dawn of electricity and galvanism, it presaged every bioethics debate we face today.

The creature's tragedy wasn't his artificial birth but society's rejection - a template for AI consciousness debates.
Victor's hubris mirrors modern tech founders: brilliant creation, zero responsibility for consequences.
"Modern Prometheus" subtitle warned us: stealing divine fire has consequences.

The novel predicted:
- Artificial life creation (synthetic biology, AI)
- Creator abandonment syndrome (launching products without support)
- Bioethics committees (IRB boards trace back to Victor's recklessness)
- Nature vs nurture in artificial beings (LLM training debates)

Shelley understood technology isn't neutral - it reflects its creator's ethics and society's prejudices.
The "monster" learned language like modern LLMs: through observation and texts.
Published anonymously because society wasn't ready for teenage girl's genius.
Still the definitive cautionary tale about unchecked scientific ambition.

Every "AI might kill us" headline echoes Mary's 200-year-old warning.
We keep building creatures and abandoning them to learn from our mistakes.
