The New Wave (1960s-70s) detonated Golden Age assumptions: psychology > physics, style > science.
Moorcock's New Worlds magazine led British invasion: Ballard, Aldiss, Delany challenged American optimism.

J.G. Ballard's manifesto: explore inner space, not outer. Psychology was the real final frontier.
His concrete islands and crystal worlds: Earth transformed by human consciousness, not alien invasion.
Ursula Le Guin brought anthropology: "Left Hand of Darkness" questioned gender before gender studies.
Philip K. Dick asked: what if reality itself is broken? Drugs, paranoia, fake memories everywhere.

New Wave innovations:
- Unreliable narrators (reflecting 60s distrust of authority)
- Stream of consciousness in spacecraft
- Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll in zero gravity
- Environmental collapse as character
- Corporate dystopias replacing galactic empires

Harlan Ellison's Dangerous Visions anthologies: taboo-breaking stories Campbell would have burned.
Literary techniques from Joyce, Burroughs imported to Mars.
The prose mattered as much as ideas - sometimes more.
Vietnam echoes: technology as defoliant, not savior.

Cyberpunk was New Wave's child: tech noir, corporate rule, consciousness as commodity.
Modern SF's diversity traces to New Wave breaking Campbell's white male engineer monopoly.
Taught us spaceships can't escape human nature - we pack our neuroses for the stars.
