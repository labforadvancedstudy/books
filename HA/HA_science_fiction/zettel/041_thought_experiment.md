SF as philosophy with plot
Each story a thought experiment in narrative form
What if? followed to dramatic conclusion
Einstein's elevator implemented in fiction

Classic SF thought experiments:
- Ship of Theseus → teleportation identity crisis
- Trolley problem → AI decision making
- Brain in vat → simulation hypothesis
- Chinese room → consciousness tests
Philosophy departments raiding SF shelves

The advantage over pure philosophy:
Emotional engagement with abstract concepts
Readers FEEL the implications
Ideas incarnated in characters we care about

The best SF thought experiments change how we think:
- Asimov's psychohistory → social physics
- Dick's reality uncertainty → simulation theory
- Gibson's cyberspace → how we see internet
Fiction becoming framework
