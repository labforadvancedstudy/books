Before Neuromancer, hackers typed green text on black screens. After: cowboys riding data streams.
Gibson's matrix wasn't internet prediction - it was internet's subconscious made manifest.

The iconic vision: geometric data fortresses floating in infinite black.
Corporate databases as physical architecture: Sense/Net's ice pyramid.
Black ICE that flatlines intruders - lethal software before viruses went mainstream.
Console cowboys jacking in - addiction metaphor that became literal with social media.

Matrix-inspired reality:
- "Ice" terminology adopted by real hackers
- Visualization tools trying to map cyberspace spatially
- VR meetings in geometric spaces (Horizon Workrooms)
- Cyber warfare visualized as physical assault
- Dark web as literal dark space

Case's brain damage preventing jack-in predicted our dopamine economics.
Molly's "simstim" - experiencing another's sensorium - prefigured Twitch streaming.
Wintermute/Neuromancer merger: AGI emerging from networked systems.
"The Matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games" - prophetic of gamification.

Every cybersecurity conference has matrix-inspired visualizations.
"Cyberspace" entered dictionaries because Gibson's metaphor stuck.
Modern internet less elegant - more surveillance mall than infinite frontier.
But when systems crash, we still say they're "flatlined."

Gibson's real insight: we'd experience data physically, not just intellectually.
