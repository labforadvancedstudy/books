# Simulation Hypothesis

## Core Insight
The ultimate SF concept eating reality. If simulated worlds outnumber real ones, probability says we're simulated. The universe runs on someone else's hardware, and physics is just the code showing through.

## Body
Bostrom formalized what SF always knew: sufficiently advanced VR becomes indistinguishable from reality. The Matrix popularized it, but Farmer's "Riverworld" and Galouye's "Simulacron-3" got there first. Once you can simulate consciousness, you will. And simulated beings will simulate beings. Turtles all the way down.

The evidence accumulates. Quantum mechanics looks like computational shortcuts - only render what's observed. Speed of light? Maximum processor clock. Planck length? Minimum pixel size. The universe quantizes because computers must. God doesn't play dice; God plays Minecraft.

But simulation explains too much. Fine-tuning problem? Someone set the parameters. Fermi paradox? NPCs don't get interstellar travel. Hard problem of consciousness? Consciousness is what simulation feels like from inside. Every mystery dissolves if we're subroutines in cosmic code.

Science fiction explored the implications. If we're simulated, can we hack out? Contact our simulators? Prove our reality? Or do we play along, knowing the admins might pull the plug? Maybe consciousness is the exploit - the bug that lets NPCs realize they're NPCs.

The real terror: it doesn't matter. Simulated suffering still hurts. Simulated love still moves. Simulated physics still binds. Whether we're meat or math, we're stuck with experience. The simulation hypothesis changes everything and nothing. We still wake, still struggle, still die - just in someone else's dream.
