# Cyberpunk

## Core Insight
High tech, low life. The future where corporations replaced governments and the street finds its own use for things. Cyberpunk didn't predict the future - it diagnosed the present.

## Body
Gibson saw it first: cyberspace as consensual hallucination, data as landscape, hackers as cowboys. Neuromancer wasn't prophecy - it was reportage from a future already emerging. The sprawl exists now: Tokyo-Yokohama, Northeast Megalopolis, Pearl River Delta. Thirty million souls under neon sky.

Cyberpunk's genius was inverting SF's optimism. Technology wouldn't unite humanity - it would stratify it. The rich would transcend biology while the poor scraped by on street-level tech. Sound familiar? Neuralink for billionaires, TikTok for masses. Gene therapy for wealthy, medical bankruptcy for poor.

The aesthetic conquered reality. Blade Runner's rain-slicked streets live in every city's Koreatown. Ghost in the Shell's cyborgs walk Boston Dynamics labs. Akira's bike gangs ride Tokyo highways. We live in cyberpunk minus the cool implants.

But cyberpunk's real prediction? The dissolution of consensus reality. When everyone has their own filtered feed, their own AR overlay, their own algorithm-curated truth, the shared world disappears. We're all console cowboys now, jacked into our personal versions of cyberspace.

The revolution isn't coming. It already happened. The corporations won. The networks merged with nervous systems. The future is here, just unevenly distributed. Chrome and meat, data and flesh, all burning bright under the same neon sun.
