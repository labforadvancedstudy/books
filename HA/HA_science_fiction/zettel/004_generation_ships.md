# Generation Ships

## Core Insight
Humanity's ark across the void. When the journey outlasts lifetimes, the ship becomes the world. Generation ships are meditation on society, evolution, and what "home" means to those who've never known Earth.

## Body
The tyranny of distance demands sacrifice. Not just of those who leave, but their children's children who never chose the journey. Tau Ceti is 12 light-years away - at 1% light speed, that's 1,200 years. Forty generations living and dying in a metal womb between stars.

Science fiction grappled with the sociology before the engineering. Heinlein's "Universe" showed knowledge degrading to mythology. Aldiss's "Non-Stop" revealed ships as evolutionary pressure cookers. Robinson's "Aurora" argued the endeavor might be fundamentally doomed - closed ecosystems always fail.

But the technical challenges spark innovation. O'Neill cylinders spinning for gravity. Closed-loop life support pushing 99.9% efficiency. Genetic diversity maintained through careful breeding protocols or embryo banks. AI custodians ensuring continuity when human institutions fail.

The real question: what arrives? After centuries, language evolves, culture shifts, bodies adapt to spin gravity. They're human, but not Earth-human. The colonists who land aren't the species that launched. Generation ships are one-way speciation events.

Maybe that's the point. Not to spread humanity, but to let humanity flower into new forms. Each ship a seed pod, each star system a garden for new kinds of human consciousness. Generation ships don't preserve our species - they transcend it.
