# 044_minecraft_cpu_consciousness

Someone built a functional CPU inside Minecraft using redstone circuits.
Then someone built a computer running Minecraft inside Minecraft.
The recursive loop of virtual worlds hosting virtual worlds began.

What started as a game became a demonstration of computational universality.
Any sufficiently complex system can simulate any other system.
Consciousness might just be a particularly interesting computation.

Virtual worlds now host genuine research: protein folding, climate modeling.
The distinction between "real" and "simulated" computation vanishes.
If consciousness is computation, where exactly does it "live"?

Players spend lifetimes in virtual worlds, forming real relationships.
Their neurons fire identically whether the experience is "real" or "virtual."
The substrate—photons or pixels—becomes irrelevant to the experience.

We used to think consciousness required biological neurons.
Then we thought it might run on silicon chips.
Now we wonder: could it run on anything sufficiently complex?

Conway's Game of Life can build universal computers from simple rules.
Minecraft can host consciousness-supporting computation.
Reality might be turtles all the way down—or games all the way up.

The existential vertigo: if consciousness can run on Minecraft redstone,
what are the odds our consciousness runs on baseline reality?
Every simulated world makes our own reality seem less foundational.
