Arthur C. Clarke proposed geostationary satellites in 1945 - before transistors existed.
His "Extra-Terrestrial Relays" paper described communication satellites so precisely, GEO is called "Clarke Orbit."

Calculated exact altitude: 35,786 km where orbital period matches Earth's rotation.
Predicted three satellites could cover Earth - exactly how GPS works today.
Didn't patent it: "I never thought it would happen in my lifetime."
Lived to see billions use his idea daily for TV, internet, navigation.

Clarke's other predictions:
- Personal computers ("2001: A Space Odyssey")
- AI consciousness and rebellion (HAL 9000)
- Space elevator ("Fountains of Paradise")
- Virtual reality ("The City and the Stars")
- Replicators/3D printing ("Rendezvous with Rama")

His laws:
1. When distinguished scientist says something is possible, probably right
2. Only way to find limits is venture past them
3. Any sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic

HAL 9000 inspired real AI research - and AI safety concerns.
"2001" collaboration with Kubrick: hard SF meets art film, influenced everything.
Predicted internet in 1964: "In 50 years... work from Tahiti as well as Manhattan."
Final prediction: mind uploading. Died before seeing if right.

Modern satellites follow Clarke's blueprints. We live in his future, bouncing signals off his imagination.
