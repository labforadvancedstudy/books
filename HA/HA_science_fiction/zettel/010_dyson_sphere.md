# Dyson Sphere

## Core Insight
The ultimate stellar engineering project. Capture a star's entire output. When civilizations hit Type II, they don't build cities - they build shells around suns. The universe might be full of stars wearing masks.

## Body
Freeman Dyson meant swarms, not solid shells. Billions of solar collectors orbiting in formation, drinking stellar fire. But science fiction loved the rigid sphere - star at center, civilization on inner surface, a world with sky made of ground. Niven's Ringworld compromised: just one ribbon around the equator.

The engineering boggles. Dismantle planets for raw material. Mercury first, then Venus. Earth's mass wouldn't dent the project. You need asteroid belts, gas giant moons, maybe import from neighboring systems. The sphere grows panel by panel, decade by decade, until the star vanishes from outside view.

But why build one? Energy abundance beyond comprehension. Run computation at stellar scale. Upload every consciousness. Simulate universes. Or just air condition planets. With Type II energy, anything becomes trivial. Death, scarcity, limitation - all solved by stellar-scale power.

SETI should look for Dyson spheres. Stars that dim without explanation. Infrared signatures where visible light should be. Advanced civilizations don't announce themselves with radio - they announce by eating stars. The galaxy might be full of them, dark bubbles we mistake for empty space.

The real insight: Dyson spheres mark the transition from biology to technology. No species stays flesh once they can harness stars. They become their machines, their machines become their worlds, their worlds swallow suns. Dyson spheres are cocoons. We don't know what emerges.
