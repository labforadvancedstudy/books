H.G. Wells invented time travel, alien invasion, genetic engineering, and atomic bombs - in fiction first.
Unlike Verne's optimism, Wells saw technology's dark potential: every tool is also a weapon.

"The Time Machine" (1895) introduced time as fourth dimension before Einstein's relativity.
But the real innovation: using sci-fi for social criticism - Eloi/Morlock = class warfare extrapolated.
"The War of the Worlds" (1898) created alien invasion genre, inspired real panic in 1938 radio broadcast.
"The Island of Dr. Moreau" (1896) predicted genetic engineering, chimeras, bioethics nightmares.

His conceptual breakthroughs:
- Invisible Man: optical physics + social isolation of power
- The World Set Free: atomic bombs in 1914 (inspired Leo Szilard)
- The Shape of Things to Come: predicted WWII, UN, space travel
- The First Men in the Moon: anti-gravity material (still waiting...)

Wells studied biology under T.H. Huxley - Darwin's bulldog shaped his worldview.
Scientific training + socialist politics = stories about technology amplifying human nature.
Created the template of "what if?" extrapolation that defines sci-fi.
His futures were warnings, not promises - Cassandra with a typewriter.

Modern dystopian fiction is Wells' children: technology solving problems while creating worse ones.
He saw what Verne missed: progress isn't always forward, and the future might eat us.
