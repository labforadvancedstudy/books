"Sense of wonder" - SF's unique high
The conceptual breakthrough that shifts reality
That moment when scale becomes visceral
When idea transforms into experience

Classic triggers: vastness of space/time
"My god, it's full of stars!"
The Total Perspective Vortex as torture
Infinity as emotional experience not abstraction

Modern wonder: complexity not just scale
Emergence, consciousness, quantum weirdness
The universe stranger than we CAN imagine
Wonder at our own cognitive limits

The addiction: readers chasing that first high
Harder to achieve as concepts normalize
Yesterday's wonder becomes today's mundane
The treadmill of conceptual novelty
