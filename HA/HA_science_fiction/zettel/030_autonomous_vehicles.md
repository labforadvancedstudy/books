Knight Rider's KITT: the dream of a car that drives itself
talks to you, protects you, becomes a companion
Total recall's Johnny Cab: the dystopian version
Minority Report's mag-lev highways: infrastructure reimagined

Reality delivered Teslas with Autopilot
Waymo taxis circling Phoenix
The future arriving unevenly distributed
Lawyers and edge cases slowing the revolution

SF got the capability right but missed the transition chaos:
- who's liable when the AI crashes?
- the uncanny valley of almost-but-not-quite autonomous
- humans terrible at supervising automation
- regulatory frameworks decades behind technology

The real discovery: driving is more edge cases than rules
Every construction zone a new puzzle
Human intuition harder to replicate than logic
