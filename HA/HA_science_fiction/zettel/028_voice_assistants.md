HAL 9000's conversational AI in 2001 set the template
for how we'd interact with intelligent systems
Calm voice, natural language, always listening
The dream and nightmare of ambient computing

From Star Trek's "Computer" to Knight Rider's KITT
SF established voice as the natural interface
No keyboards, no screens - just conversation
Making computers invisible through speech

Today's Alexa/Siri/Google Assistant fulfill the dream
minus the homicidal tendencies (we hope)
The uncanny valley of almost-but-not-quite understanding
Convenience wrestling with surveillance anxiety

HAL's legacy: we wanted the helpful AI
but got the always-listening surveillance too
The SF warning embedded in the wish fulfillment
