Video calls: the most predicted yet delayed SF technology
From Metropolis (1927) to The Jetsons
Every future had face-to-face communication through screens
Yet it took a pandemic to make it ubiquitous

AT&T's Picturephone failed in the 1960s
despite matching SF's vision perfectly
The technology was ready but culture wasn't
People didn't want to be seen while talking

SF missed the social resistance:
- need to look presentable
- loss of privacy
- cognitive load of being "on camera"
- Zoom fatigue as real phenomenon

The irony: we got the tech but use it reluctantly
turning cameras off whenever possible
SF imagined eager adoption; reality brought exhaustion
