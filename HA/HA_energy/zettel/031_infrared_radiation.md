# Infrared Radiation

## Core Insight
Heat announcing itself as light we cannot see - all warm objects glow in the invisible spectrum.

Everything warmer than absolute zero emits infrared radiation. Your body glows with it right now - about 100 watts of invisible light streaming from your skin. Night vision goggles don't amplify light; they reveal the infrared glow of warm objects.

This is how Earth stays cool despite constant sunlight: it radiates infrared back to space. Greenhouse gases trap some of this radiation, keeping us warm. Too much trapping, and we overheat. The planetary energy balance depends on this invisible glow.

Infrared is just light with wavelengths longer than red - electromagnetic waves like visible light but carrying thermal information instead of visual. When you feel warmth from a fire without touching it, you're absorbing infrared photons, each carrying a tiny packet of energy across empty space.
