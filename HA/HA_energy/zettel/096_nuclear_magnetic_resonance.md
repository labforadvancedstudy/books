# Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

## Core Insight
Atomic nuclei singing in magnetic fields - using spin flips to probe matter's interior.

NMR exploits nuclear spin. Some nuclei (like hydrogen) are tiny magnets. In strong magnetic fields, they align with or against the field - two energy states. Radio waves at precisely the right frequency flip spins between states.

The resonance frequency depends on the local magnetic environment. Electrons nearby shield nuclei slightly, shifting resonance. This chemical shift reveals molecular structure. Every hydrogen in a molecule resonates at a slightly different frequency, creating a molecular fingerprint.

MRI is NMR applied to humans. Hydrogen in water and fat resonates differently, creating contrast. By mapping hydrogen throughout the body, we see soft tissue in exquisite detail. It's quantum mechanics making medical diagnoses.
