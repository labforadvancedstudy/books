# Warmth

## Core Insight
The sensation of heat on skin - humanity's first conscious experience of energy transfer.

When you place your hand near a fire, you feel something invisible flowing toward you. This isn't just heat - it's energy in motion, crossing space without any material carrier. A child knows this before they can speak: fire gives warmth, sun gives warmth, mother gives warmth.

The remarkable thing about warmth is its directionality. It always flows from the fire to your hand, never the reverse. You can't make the fire warmer by being cold near it. This asymmetry puzzled humanity for millennia.
