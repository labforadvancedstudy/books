# Quantum Mechanics

## Core Insight
Energy comes in discrete packets - the universe is digital at the smallest scales.

Quantum mechanics began with a puzzle: hot objects should radiate infinite energy according to classical physics. Planck's desperate fix - energy comes in chunks E = hf - saved physics and revealed nature's granularity. Energy isn't continuous; it's quantized.

This discreteness appears everywhere. Electrons in atoms have specific energy levels. Light comes in photons. Angular momentum comes in units of ħ. The universe runs on discrete transactions, not continuous flows. We live in a digital reality that appears analog at large scales.

The uncertainty principle links energy to time: ΔE × Δt ≥ ħ/2. The more precisely you know a system's energy, the less precisely you know when. Virtual particles exploit this, borrowing energy briefly. The universe allows energy conservation violation if you pay it back quickly enough.
