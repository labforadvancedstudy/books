# Special Relativity

## Core Insight
Space and time bend to keep light speed constant - energy and mass become one.

Einstein's revelation: light speed is the same for all observers. This simple statement shatters common sense. If you chase a light beam at 99% light speed, it still outruns you at exactly c. Space contracts and time dilates to maintain this cosmic speed limit.

For energy, the consequences are profound. Mass is just frozen energy (E=mc²). Kinetic energy adds to mass. A hot object literally weighs more than a cold one. A fast particle gains mass, requiring ever more energy to accelerate further. At light speed, mass would be infinite.

Energy and momentum form a four-vector in spacetime, conserved not separately but together. What looks like pure energy to one observer might be mass plus kinetic energy to another. The universe doesn't distinguish - it's all energy-momentum in different guises.
