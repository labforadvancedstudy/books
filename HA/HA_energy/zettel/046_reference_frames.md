# Reference Frames

## Core Insight
Energy depends on perspective - motion and height only exist relative to something else.

A train passenger holds a coffee cup. To them, it has zero kinetic energy. To someone on the platform, it's screaming along at 100 mph with considerable kinetic energy. Who's right? Both. Energy isn't absolute - it depends on your reference frame.

This isn't just philosophical musing. It has real consequences. A meteorite has enormous kinetic energy relative to Earth, but zero relative to itself. GPS satellites must account for gravitational potential energy differences. Even chemical energy depends on what you call "zero."

The universe has no preferred reference frame. No absolute rest, no universal "ground level." Energy values only make sense when you specify: relative to what? This relativity of energy puzzled physicists until Einstein showed it was fundamental.
