# Charge Separation

## Core Insight
Creating electrical potential by forcing like charges together - nature's reluctant energy storage.

Charges don't want to separate. Like charges repel, opposite charges attract. Yet we force them apart in every battery, capacitor, and thundercloud. This forced separation stores energy like a compressed spring stores mechanical energy.

In batteries, chemical reactions pump electrons from one terminal to the other. In thunderclouds, updrafts and downdrafts separate charges on a massive scale. In capacitors, voltage forces electrons onto one plate and off another. All store energy in the electric field between separated charges.

The energy required to separate charges equals the energy released when they reunite. This is why lightning is so powerful - millions of volts worth of separated charge reuniting in microseconds dumps enormous energy into a tiny channel of air.
