# Combustion

## Core Insight
Rapid oxidation releasing chemical bond energy - controlled molecular violence.

Combustion is chemistry at war. Oxygen atoms, those electron-hungry bullies, rip apart fuel molecules to form new, lower-energy bonds. The energy difference escapes as heat and light. What seems like destruction is actually reconstruction at the molecular level.

Fire is just fast rust. Both involve oxygen claiming electrons from other atoms. The difference is speed: rust takes years, fire takes seconds. The energy release is the same; fire just dumps it all at once.

Modern civilization runs on combustion: car engines, power plants, furnaces, rockets. We've become masters at controlling this chemical violence, metering out molecular destruction to power our world. But the chemistry remains what cavemen discovered: carbon plus oxygen equals heat.
