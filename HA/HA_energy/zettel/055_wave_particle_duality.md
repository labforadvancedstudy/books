# Wave-Particle Duality

## Core Insight
Energy doesn't choose between wave and particle - it's both, always, impossibly.

Light behaves as waves (interference, diffraction) and particles (photoelectric effect, photon counting). Electrons act as particles (tracks in cloud chambers) and waves (electron diffraction). This isn't confusion - it's fundamental reality being richer than our classical categories.

The energy determines the balance. Low energy photons (radio waves) act mostly wave-like. High energy photons (gamma rays) act mostly particle-like. But both aspects are always present. We just see the aspect our experiment probes.

This duality extends to all matter and energy. Everything propagates as waves and interacts as particles. The universe doesn't recognize our wave/particle distinction. Energy flows in quantum packets that interfere with themselves. Accept the paradox.
