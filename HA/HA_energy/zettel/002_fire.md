# Fire

## Core Insight
The transformation of matter into light and heat - humanity's first controlled energy conversion.

Fire is pure energy transformation made visible. Wood disappears, replaced by dancing flames, crackling sounds, smoke, and warmth. A child staring into a campfire witnesses E=mc² without knowing it - mass literally converting to energy before their eyes.

For 400,000 years, humans have known: fire consumes fuel, produces heat and light, and leaves only ash. We've built civilizations on this knowledge. Yet only in the last 200 years did we understand we're watching rapid oxidation - stored chemical energy violently reuniting with oxygen.

Fire is democratic. It will burn for anyone who feeds it fuel and air. It cares nothing for rank or belief. This reliability made it humanity's first universal technology.
