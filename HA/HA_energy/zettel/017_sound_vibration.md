# Sound Vibration

## Core Insight
Energy traveling as compression waves through matter - motion without movement.

When you speak, your vocal cords vibrate, pushing air molecules which push their neighbors which push theirs. Energy ripples outward at 343 meters per second. The air molecules themselves barely move - they just jostle in place, passing energy like a crowd doing the wave.

Children discover sound's energy through feeling: place a hand on a speaker, feel the thump of bass. Shout in a canyon, hear energy bounce back seconds later. Break a glass with the right frequency - sound energy becoming destructive mechanical force.

Sound is proof that energy doesn't need matter to move, only through it. The molecules stay put; the wave pattern travels. In space, no one can hear you scream because there's no medium to carry the energy waves.
