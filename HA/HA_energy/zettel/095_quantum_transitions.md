# Quantum Transitions

## Core Insight
Electrons jumping between energy levels - nature's discrete energy transactions.

Electrons in atoms can't have any energy - only specific values. They occupy discrete energy levels like steps on a staircase. To change levels, they must absorb or emit exactly the energy difference. No gradual slides allowed.

This quantization creates spectral fingerprints. Each element has unique energy levels, thus unique photon energies it can absorb/emit. Neon signs glow red because that's neon's electron transition energy. Stars reveal their composition through spectral lines.

The selection rules are strict. Not all transitions are allowed - quantum mechanics forbids certain jumps. This creates metastable states where electrons get stuck in high energy levels, waiting millions of times longer than usual to decay. Lasers exploit these forbidden transitions.
