# Wave Power Generation

## Core Insight
Extracting energy from ocean's restlessness - harvesting wind's aquatic afterthoughts.

Wave power is wind energy once removed. Wind transfers energy to water surface, creating waves that can travel thousands of miles. Unlike wind, waves are predictable days in advance and pack energy densely - up to 100 kW per meter of wavefront.

The challenge is extraction. Waves are oscillatory - up/down, back/forth - while generators want unidirectional rotation. Solutions include:
- Oscillating water columns (waves compress air)
- Point absorbers (buoys bobbing with waves)
- Attenuators (snake-like devices flexing with waves)

The ocean never rests, making wave power remarkably consistent. But salt water corrodes, storms destroy, and maintenance costs soar. We're still learning to efficiently pickpocket Neptune.
