# Potential Energy Types

## Core Insight
Energy stored in position, configuration, or strain - the universe's various savings accounts.

Potential energy comes in many flavors, each storing work done against a different force:
- Gravitational: height in a gravity field
- Elastic: stretched springs or bent beams  
- Chemical: electron arrangements in molecules
- Electrical: separated charges
- Nuclear: nucleons held against their will
- Magnetic: aligned magnetic domains

All share a common theme: something forced away from its preferred state, storing the work done. Release the constraint and potential becomes kinetic. The universe remembers every forced separation, every stretched spring, every lifted weight.

Each type has its own equation, but all represent the same concept: energy invested in configuration, waiting for release.
