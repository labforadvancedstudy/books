# Fuel

## Core Insight
Matter that contains trapped energy, waiting for release - nature's battery technology.

A child learns quickly: fire needs food. Wood burns, water doesn't. Paper burns, rocks don't. Some things contain hidden fire-potential, others don't. This selection isn't random - it's about molecular bonds storing energy from ancient sunlight.

Fuel is patient. A log can sit for years, holding its energy quietly. But add a spark and oxygen, and suddenly all that patient storage explodes into heat and light. Whether it's wood, coal, gasoline, or uranium, fuel is just matter with energy locked in molecular or nuclear cages.

The history of civilization is largely the history of finding better fuels: wood → coal → oil → uranium → perhaps fusion. Each leap means more energy from less matter.
