# Solar Panels

## Core Insight
Semiconductor light traps - converting photons directly to flowing electrons.

Solar panels perform the universe's most elegant energy conversion: light in, electricity out. No moving parts, no emissions, no fuel. Just silicon wafers with built-in electric fields that bully photon-liberated electrons into flowing through circuits.

The photovoltaic effect is quantum mechanics made practical. Photons with enough energy knock electrons from silicon's valence band to conduction band. The panel's p-n junction creates an electric field that separates these charges before they recombine. Free electrons flow through external circuits as current.

Efficiency has climbed from 6% (1954) to 26% (2024) for commercial panels. The theoretical limit for single-junction silicon is 33%. Multi-junction cells approach 47%. We're converting ancient fusion energy (sunlight) to modern needs with improving elegance.
