# Pressure Differences

## Core Insight
Nature abhors pressure gradients - imbalances that drive flow until equilibrium returns.

Pressure differences are nature's way of storing mechanical potential energy in fluids. High pressure wants to become low pressure, and will push anything in its way to achieve this. Wind is air flowing from high to low pressure. Ocean currents are water seeking pressure balance.

The atmosphere is a massive pressure engine. Sunlight creates temperature differences, temperature differences create pressure differences, pressure differences create wind. It's solar energy converted to mechanical energy through the medium of pressure gradients.

This principle scales from microscopic (how lungs work) to planetary (weather systems). Your car tires store energy as pressure difference from atmosphere. Steam engines exploited pressure differences to power the industrial revolution. Pressure gradients are gradients of opportunity.
