# Galilean Relativity

## Core Insight
Motion is relative, but time is absolute - Newton's sensible universe before Einstein.

Galileo realized: in a smooth-sailing ship's cabin, no experiment can tell if you're moving. Pour water, drop balls, jump - everything behaves identically whether docked or sailing. Motion only exists relative to something else. There's no absolute rest.

This relativity worked perfectly for centuries. Velocities add simply: walk 3 mph on a 20 mph train, you move 23 mph relative to ground. Energy depends on reference frame - that coffee cup has different kinetic energy to different observers. All sensible.

The crack appeared with light. Maxwell's equations gave light a specific speed, but relative to what? The luminiferous aether? But no experiment could detect Earth's motion through it. Galilean relativity worked for everything except light.
