# Resonance

## Core Insight
Energy transfer through matched frequencies - the universe's way of playing favorites.

Push a swing randomly and little happens. Push at its natural frequency and amplitude builds dramatically. This is resonance: when driving frequency matches natural frequency, energy transfers efficiently. Small pushes create large effects through timing.

Resonance is everywhere. Microwave ovens heat water by matching molecular rotation frequencies. Radio tuners select stations by resonating with specific carrier frequencies. Bridges collapse when soldiers march in step. Opera singers shatter glasses with pure notes.

The deeper truth: every system has natural frequencies where it "wants" to oscillate. Find these frequencies and you hold the keys to efficient energy transfer. Miss them and your energy dissipates uselessly. Resonance is nature's combination lock for energy coupling.
