# Battery Storage

## Core Insight
Chemical potential waiting to become electrical flow - patience in a can.

A battery is bottled lightning, tamed and made portable. Inside, chemicals yearn to react but are kept separate by design. Connect the terminals, and their reunion generates electron flow. Chemical energy becomes electrical energy on demand.

Children know batteries make toys work, flashlights shine, phones live. They learn the heartbreak of "dead" batteries - the chemicals have found equilibrium, the potential is spent. The energy hasn't vanished; it's been transformed to light, sound, motion, heat.

From Baghdad batteries to lithium-ion, the principle remains: use chemistry to pump electrons uphill, then let them flow down through your device. It's a electron waterfall you can carry in your pocket.
