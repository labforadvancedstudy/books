# Triboelectric Effect

## Core Insight
Friction stealing electrons - how rubbing creates electrical separation.

When different materials rub together, electrons jump ship. The triboelectric series ranks materials by their electron greed: fur loses electrons easily, rubber grabs them eagerly. Rub fur on rubber, and electrons transfer, leaving fur positive and rubber negative.

This isn't magic - it's surfaces at the atomic level making and breaking contact millions of times. Each contact allows electron clouds to overlap briefly. When they separate, some electrons choose to stay with their preferred host. Multiply by millions of contacts, and you get measurable charge separation.

Ancient Greeks rubbed amber on fur and watched it attract feathers. They named this "electron" (Greek for amber). 2,500 years later, we generate thousands of volts the same way, just by walking on carpet. The effect that named electricity still surprises us daily.
