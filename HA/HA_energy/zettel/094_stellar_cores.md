# Stellar Cores

## Core Insight
Gravity-powered fusion furnaces - where matter transforms to energy on industrial scales.

Stellar cores are the universe's power plants. Gravity crushes hydrogen until quantum tunneling enables fusion despite electromagnetic repulsion. The energy released creates outward pressure, balancing gravity. Stars are self-regulating fusion reactors.

The proton-proton chain fuses four hydrogen into helium, converting 0.7% of mass to energy. The sun processes 600 million tons per second, losing 4 million tons to pure energy. This has powered Earth's biosphere for billions of years.

Temperature determines fusion pathway. Below 15 million K: proton-proton chain. Above: CNO cycle. Massive stars burn through successive fuels - helium, carbon, oxygen, silicon - until iron. Iron fusion consumes energy, gravity wins, supernova results. Stellar death spreads heavy elements, enabling planets and life.
