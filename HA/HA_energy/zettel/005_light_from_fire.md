# Light from Fire

## Core Insight
Energy announcing itself across space - the first wireless communication.

Fire doesn't just warm; it illuminates. This light travels instantly (seemingly) across the cave, casting dancing shadows, revealing faces. Before humans had language, fire's light was already demonstrating that energy can leap through empty space.

A child watching flames sees colors: blue at the base (hottest), yellow in the middle, orange at the tips. They're witnessing blackbody radiation without knowing it - matter so energized it must shed photons or burst. Temperature made visible.

For most of human history, fire and sun were our only lights. Every artificial photon came from combustion until Edison's bulb introduced a new magic: light from electricity.
