# Entropy

## Core Insight
Energy's tendency to spread out - the universe's preference for disorder and the arrow of time.

Entropy isn't disorder in the messy room sense. It's energy spreading out, becoming less useful. A hot cup in a cold room has low entropy - energy is concentrated. After cooling, entropy is higher - same total energy, but spread uselessly through the room.

This spreading is probabilistic inevitability. There are vastly more ways for energy to be spread out than concentrated. Just as shuffled cards don't accidentally sort themselves, spread energy doesn't spontaneously reconcentrate. Time's arrow points toward increasing entropy.

Life appears to violate this by creating order. But we don't. We concentrate energy locally by spreading even more energy globally. Every ordered cell requires disordered heat dumped into the environment. We're entropy accelerators, not entropy reversers.
