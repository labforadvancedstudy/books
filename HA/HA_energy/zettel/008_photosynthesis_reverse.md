# Photosynthesis Reverse

## Core Insight
Life's energy banking system - writing checks that fire cashes.

Photosynthesis and combustion are opposing poems written in the same language. Plants write: CO₂ + H₂O + sunlight → sugar + O₂. Fire reads it backwards: sugar + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + heat + light.

This isn't coincidence. It's the fundamental energy cycle of Earth's biosphere. Plants are solar panels that store energy in chemical bonds. Animals (including us) are controlled combustion chambers, slowly burning that stored sunlight to power our movements and thoughts.

When you eat salad, you're eating packaged sunlight. When you burn wood, you're unleashing it. The same carbon atoms cycle between atmosphere and life, carrying energy from sun to cell to flame and back again.
