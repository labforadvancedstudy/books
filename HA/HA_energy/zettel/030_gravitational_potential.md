# Gravitational Potential

## Core Insight
Mass separated in space stores energy - the universe remembering how things came apart.

Gravitational potential energy is the universe's memory of work done against gravity. Lift a rock, and spacetime itself remembers this separation of masses. The energy isn't "in" the rock or "in" Earth - it's in the relationship, the configuration, the geometric fact of their separation.

This energy is patient beyond belief. The moon has been storing gravitational potential energy relative to Earth for billions of years. Comets store it for millions of years between visits. The universe never forgets a lifted weight.

The formula PE = mgh works near Earth's surface, but the deeper truth is PE = -GMm/r. Negative because gravity is attractive; you do work to separate masses. The universe "wants" masses together, and remembers every separation with stored energy.
