# Fusion Energy

## Core Insight
Forcing light nuclei to marry - recreating stellar furnaces on Earth.

Fusion is fission's opposite: instead of splitting heavy nuclei, we merge light ones. Hydrogen isotopes fuse into helium, converting 0.7% of mass to energy. This powers stars and hydrogen bombs. The challenge: achieving it controllably on Earth.

The difficulty is Coulomb barrier - positive nuclei repel violently. Stars overcome this with crushing gravity creating extreme density and temperature. We must use magnetic bottles (tokamaks) or laser implosion (inertial confinement) to create stellar conditions briefly.

The promise: seawater contains enough deuterium to power civilization for billions of years. No carbon emissions, minimal radioactive waste, no meltdown risk. The joke: fusion is always 30 years away. But ITER and private ventures are closing the gap.
