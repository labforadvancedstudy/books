# Simple Machines

## Core Insight
Force-distance traders - humanity's first energy transformation devices.

Simple machines don't create energy; they reshape how we apply it. A lever trades distance for force. A pulley redirects force. An inclined plane spreads force over distance. All obey the golden rule: work in equals work out (minus friction).

These were humanity's first physics insights made practical:
- Lever: small force × long distance = large force × short distance
- Wheel: convert sliding friction to rolling friction
- Pulley: redirect force, multiply mechanical advantage
- Screw: wrap an inclined plane around a cylinder
- Wedge: redirect perpendicular force to splitting force

Every complex machine is combinations of these basics. A car engine is levers (pistons) and wheels (crankshaft). The genius wasn't inventing energy but learning to redirect it efficiently.
