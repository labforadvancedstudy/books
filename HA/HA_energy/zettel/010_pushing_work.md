# Pushing Work

## Core Insight
Force through distance equals energy transfer - the universe's labor law.

When you push a heavy box across the floor, you get tired. Why? You're transferring energy from your muscles (chemical) to the box (kinetic) and floor (heat from friction). The harder you push and the farther you push, the more energy you spend.

Children learn this through exhaustion: pushing the merry-go-round, pulling the wagon, lifting blocks. They discover that pushing against a wall (no movement) feels different from pushing a rolling ball (movement). One drains you, the other doesn't - or does it?

This is work in the physics sense: force times distance. No movement, no work, no energy transfer - though your muscles burn energy isometrically just maintaining force.
