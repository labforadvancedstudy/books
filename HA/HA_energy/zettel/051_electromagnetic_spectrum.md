# Electromagnetic Spectrum

## Core Insight
Energy's rainbow from radio to gamma rays - all light, just different energies per photon.

The electromagnetic spectrum is energy's grand parade. Radio waves carry whispers of energy per photon. Visible light carries enough to trigger chemical changes in your retina. X-rays pack enough punch to ionize atoms. Gamma rays can shatter nuclei.

It's all the same phenomenon - oscillating electric and magnetic fields propagating at c. The only difference is frequency, which determines energy per photon (E = hf). Double the frequency, double the energy. This linear relationship makes the spectrum a pure energy ladder.

We evolved to see the tiny slice where the sun peaks and water is transparent. But the universe communicates across the entire spectrum. Stars scream in gamma rays, galaxies whisper in radio, and the Big Bang's echo hums in microwaves.
