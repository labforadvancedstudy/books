# Voltage Potential

## Core Insight
Electrical pressure measured in volts - the push that makes charges flow.

Voltage is desire quantified. It measures how badly charges want to move from one place to another. Like water pressure in a dam, voltage represents potential energy per unit charge. High voltage means each electron carries more energy downhill.

A bird can sit on a 10,000-volt power line because voltage needs difference. The bird is at 10,000 volts everywhere - no gradient, no current, no problem. Touch ground while holding that wire, and you become the path for energy descent.

This is why voltage doesn't kill - current does. Voltage is just potential; current is that potential realized as flow. A Van de Graaff generator at 100,000 volts gives harmless sparks (microamps), while a car battery at 12 volts can weld metal (hundreds of amps).
