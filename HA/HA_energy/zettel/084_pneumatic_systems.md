# Pneumatic Systems

## Core Insight
Compressed air as energy storage - using atmosphere as a spring.

Pneumatic systems store energy by compressing air, release it by letting air expand. It's mechanical battery technology - pump energy in to compress, extract energy as air pushes back. Simple, reliable, but inefficient due to heat losses during compression.

Air tools demonstrate the principle: compress air at central station, pipe it around factory, use it to drive tools. The energy density is poor (air at 300 psi stores only 0.1 MJ/L vs gasoline's 35 MJ/L) but air is free and clean.

Large-scale compressed air energy storage (CAES) uses underground caverns to store grid electricity as compressed air. Efficiency is 40-50% due to compression heating, but improving with heat recovery. It's geology-dependent but potentially massive.
