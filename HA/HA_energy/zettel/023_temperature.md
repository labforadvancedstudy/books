# Temperature

## Core Insight
Average kinetic energy of particles - motion we feel but cannot see.

Temperature is statistical violence. In hot water, molecules slam around faster than in cold water. Temperature measures this average molecular speed. You can't feel individual molecules, but your nerves detect their collective assault.

This explains why there's an absolute zero (-273.15°C): it's when molecular motion stops. You can't have negative motion. Temperature has a floor but no ceiling - particle speeds can approach (but never reach) light speed.

The weird part: temperature is only meaningful for collections. A single molecule doesn't have temperature, just velocity. Temperature emerges from the crowd, a statistical property that requires many particles to exist. It's our first hint that some properties only exist at scale.
