# Solar Constant

## Core Insight
1,361 watts per square meter - the sun's steady energy gift to Earth's orbit.

The solar constant isn't perfectly constant, but it's close enough. For billions of years, the sun has delivered roughly the same power density to Earth's orbital distance. This stability allowed life to evolve, depending on predictable energy input.

Do the math: Earth's cross-section intercepts about 174 petawatts of solar power. That's 10,000 times human civilization's energy use. We're fighting over energy while drowning in it. The challenge isn't scarcity but collection and storage.

This "constant" drives everything: weather (uneven heating), ocean currents (thermal gradients), photosynthesis (the base of food chains), and ultimately all renewable energy (wind, hydro, biomass). Fossil fuels are just ancient solar constant, compressed and stored.
