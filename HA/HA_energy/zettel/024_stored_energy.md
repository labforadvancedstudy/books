# Stored Energy

## Core Insight
Energy in waiting - the universe's savings accounts in various forms.

Energy storage is time travel for power. A lifted rock stores work done against gravity. A compressed spring stores elastic strain. A charged battery stores electrical potential. Food stores chemical energy. All wait patiently to release their energy when triggered.

Nature has been perfecting storage for billions of years. Fat cells store months of energy. Trees store decades of solar capture. Coal beds store millions of years of compressed forest. Uranium stores energy from supernovas billions of years ago.

The challenge of storage defines civilizations. Agricultural societies stored energy as grain. Industrial societies stored it as coal and oil. Our future depends on finding better ways to store renewable energy - catching intermittent wind and sun for when we need it.
