# Oxidation Reaction

## Core Insight
Electrons changing teams - the universe's most common energy-releasing reaction.

Oxidation is electron theft. Oxygen, that electronic bully with its nearly-full outer shell, rips electrons from other atoms. This isn't gentle - it releases energy. Fire is violent oxidation. Rust is patient oxidation. Your cells breathing is controlled oxidation.

The name is historical accident - oxygen isn't always involved. Any electron loss is "oxidation." But oxygen is so good at it, so ubiquitous, that it named the whole category. When iron rusts, when glucose burns in your cells, when hydrogen explodes - all oxidation.

Life exists in the sweet spot between too much oxidation (combustion) and too little (suffocation). We've evolved to surf the edge of oxidation, extracting energy without burning up.
