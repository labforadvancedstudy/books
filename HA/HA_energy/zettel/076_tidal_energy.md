# Tidal Energy

## Core Insight
Gravity-powered clockwork - the moon's daily energy gift to coastal waters.

Tidal energy is the only renewable not ultimately solar. It's gravitational, driven by moon's pull on Earth's oceans. As Earth rotates under tidal bulges, coastal areas experience rising and falling seas with clockwork reliability.

This predictability is tidal energy's superpower. Unlike wind or solar, we know exactly when tides will flow, how high, how fast, centuries in advance. It's the most reliable renewable, courtesy of orbital mechanics.

Extraction methods mirror hydroelectric: tidal barrages create height differences, tidal streams spin underwater turbines. The Bay of Fundy's 16-meter tides could power Atlantic Canada. The challenge is environmental - altering tidal flows affects entire ecosystems.
