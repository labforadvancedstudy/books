# Second Law

## Core Insight
Entropy always increases in isolated systems - the universe's only truly inviolable law.

The second law of thermodynamics is special. Other laws say what stays constant. This one says what must change: entropy increases. Always. Without exception. It's less a law we discovered than a logical necessity we recognized.

You can decrease entropy locally (make ice, build a house, create life) but only by increasing it more elsewhere. Every refrigerator heats the room more than it cools the inside. Every living thing hastens universal entropy by organizing itself.

This law makes time travel paradoxes, perpetual motion machines, and perfect efficiency impossible. It's why we age, why stars die, why everything breaks. It's not that energy disappears - it just becomes less useful, spreading into unavailable heat.
