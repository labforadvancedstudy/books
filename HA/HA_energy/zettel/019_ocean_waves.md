# Ocean Waves

## Core Insight
Wind's energy archived in water - the sea's kinetic library.

Ocean waves are wind's autobiography written in water. Each wave carries a memory of the storm that birthed it, traveling across oceans long after the wind has died. Surfers ride historical records of distant weather events.

Watch waves approach a beach: far out, they're just energy patterns in deep water. As they feel the bottom, they slow down, pile up, and eventually break - kinetic energy transforming into turbulent heat and sound. The roar of surf is energy's death cry.

Wave power is immense - a single meter of wavefront can carry 100 kilowatts. Capturing this energy is engineering's challenge: how to steal power from patterns that never stop moving.
