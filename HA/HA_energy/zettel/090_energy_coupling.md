# Energy Coupling

## Core Insight
Using favorable reactions to drive unfavorable ones - life's thermodynamic sleight of hand.

Energy coupling is biology's essential trick. Many necessary reactions require energy input (endergonic). Life couples these to energy-releasing reactions (exergonic), using the excess from one to power the other. It's thermodynamic trickery at the molecular scale.

ATP hydrolysis is the universal coupling agent. It releases 7.3 kcal/mol - enough to drive most cellular reactions but not so much that energy is wasted. Enzymes physically link ATP breakdown to energy-requiring processes, ensuring the energy transfers rather than dissipating as heat.

This coupling enables life's uphill battles: building proteins (requires energy), pumping ions against gradients (requires energy), moving muscles (requires energy). All coupled to ATP's downhill tumble. Without coupling, life would be thermodynamically impossible.
