# Absolute Zero

## Core Insight
The temperature where motion stops - the universe's energy floor that can't quite be reached.

Absolute zero (-273.15°C or 0 Kelvin) is where classical motion ceases. No vibration, no rotation, no translation. It's not just very cold - it's the complete absence of thermal kinetic energy. Temperature can't go lower because you can't have less motion than none.

But quantum mechanics intervenes. Even at absolute zero, particles retain zero-point energy - a quantum jitter that can't be stilled. The uncertainty principle forbids perfect stillness. Atoms at 0K still vibrate, just in their lowest possible energy state.

We can approach but never reach absolute zero. Each halving of temperature requires doubling the effort. The third law of thermodynamics makes it official: reaching absolute zero would take infinite steps. The universe has a basement we can see but never enter.
