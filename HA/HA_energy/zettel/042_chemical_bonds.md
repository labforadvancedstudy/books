# Chemical Bonds

## Core Insight
Atoms holding hands with electrons - energy stored in the grip strength of molecular relationships.

Chemical bonds are energy contracts between atoms. When atoms share or exchange electrons to form bonds, energy releases. Breaking bonds requires energy input. All chemical energy is really bond energy - the difference between what you break and what you form.

A glucose molecule is a carefully arranged collection of carbon-hydrogen and carbon-oxygen bonds, each storing a specific amount of energy. Burn it, and you're really just rearranging these bonds into lower-energy configurations (CO₂ and H₂O), pocketing the energy difference.

The universe has bond preferences. Some atoms desperately want to bond (sodium with chlorine), others bond reluctantly (nitrogen with nitrogen). These preferences, encoded in electron configurations, determine which reactions release energy and which consume it.
