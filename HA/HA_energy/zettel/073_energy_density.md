# Energy Density

## Core Insight
Energy per unit mass or volume - the universe's packaging efficiency for portable power.

Energy density determines practicality. Wood has 16 MJ/kg, gasoline 46 MJ/kg, uranium-235 an astounding 79,500,000 MJ/kg. This ratio explains history: we moved from wood to coal (24 MJ/kg) to oil to nuclear as we discovered denser energy packages.

Batteries lag badly. Lithium-ion peaks at 0.7 MJ/kg - 65 times less than gasoline. This is why electric cars need huge battery packs and why planes still burn jet fuel. Chemistry can't match the density of molecular bonds, let alone nuclear ones.

The fundamental limit: E=mc². Matter itself has an energy density of 90,000,000,000 MJ/kg. We tap a tiny fraction through chemistry (electron rearrangement) or fission (nucleus splitting). Antimatter would achieve 100% conversion, but good luck storing it.
