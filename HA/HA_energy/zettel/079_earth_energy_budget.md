# Earth Energy Budget

## Core Insight
Planetary accounting of energy in and out - the balance sheet that determines climate.

Earth receives 174 petawatts from the sun. About 30% reflects immediately (albedo). The rest absorbs, drives weather, photosynthesis, and ocean currents, then re-radiates as infrared. In equals out, or temperature changes.

The breakdown:
- Atmosphere and clouds absorb 19%
- Surface absorbs 51%
- Reflected by clouds and atmosphere 26%
- Reflected by surface 4%

All absorbed energy must eventually leave as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases slow this departure, warming the surface. It's a dynamic equilibrium - change any term and temperature adjusts to rebalance.

Human impact seems tiny - civilization uses 18 terawatts, just 0.01% of solar input. But we're changing the atmosphere's infrared opacity, altering the entire balance. Small percentage, large consequence.
