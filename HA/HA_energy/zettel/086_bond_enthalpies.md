# Bond Enthalpies

## Core Insight
The price list for breaking and forming molecular bonds - chemistry's energy accounting table.

Every chemical bond has a specific energy: the amount needed to break it or released when forming it. C-H bonds store 413 kJ/mol, C=O bonds 799 kJ/mol, H-H bonds 436 kJ/mol. These numbers determine whether reactions release or consume energy.

Combustion math is simple: add energy to break fuel bonds, subtract energy from forming product bonds. Methane burning: break 4 C-H and 2 O=O (2648 kJ), form 2 C=O and 4 O-H (3338 kJ). Net: 690 kJ released per mole. That's why it burns.

This accounting explains everything from metabolism to explosives. Life carefully manages bond breaking and forming to extract maximum useful energy. Explosives arrange molecules to maximize the difference between weak bonds broken and strong bonds formed.
