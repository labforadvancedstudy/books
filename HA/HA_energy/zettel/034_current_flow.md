# Current Flow

## Core Insight
Rivers of electrons carrying energy through conductors - charge in organized motion.

Electric current is a democratic parade of electrons, each carrying a tiny bit of energy. In a copper wire, about 10^23 electrons drift slowly (millimeters per second) but their collective effect travels near light speed. It's like a pipe already full of water - push at one end, flow emerges instantly at the other.

Current times voltage equals power - the rate of energy delivery. A small current at high voltage delivers the same power as large current at low voltage. This is why power lines use high voltage: less current means less loss to wire resistance.

The shocking realization: in AC current, electrons don't actually travel from power plant to your home. They just wiggle back and forth 60 times per second. It's the wave of wiggling that carries energy, not the electrons themselves.
