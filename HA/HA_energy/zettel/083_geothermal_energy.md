# Geothermal Energy

## Core Insight
Tapping Earth's primordial heat - mining the planet's thermal battery.

Geothermal energy is planetary heat left over from formation plus ongoing radioactive decay. Earth's core is 6000°C - as hot as the sun's surface. This heat conducts slowly outward, occasionally breaking through as volcanoes or hot springs.

We tap it by drilling into hot rock, circulating water to extract heat. Iceland generates 25% of its electricity from geothermal, plus heats 90% of buildings. It's baseload renewable - always on, weather independent.

The ultimate resource is vast - Earth contains 10^31 joules of thermal energy. But accessibility limits us. Deep drilling is expensive, and most heat is too deep or too diffuse. Enhanced geothermal systems (fracking for heat) might unlock more, but we're still learning to efficiently mine Earth's heat.
