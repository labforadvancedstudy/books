# Mechanical Advantage

## Core Insight
Trading force for distance - the universe's fair exchange rate for mechanical work.

Mechanical advantage is honest cheating. You can't create energy, but you can multiply force by dividing distance. A 10:1 lever multiplies your force by 10, but you must move 10 times farther. The work (force × distance) remains constant - only the proportion changes.

This trade-off enabled civilization. Humans are weak but clever. We can't lift boulders, but we can move levers. We can't pull up heavy loads, but we can pull down with our weight. Mechanical advantage let us build beyond our biological limits.

The beauty: it's just geometry. A lever's ratio is its arm lengths. A pulley system's advantage equals its rope segments. An inclined plane's advantage is length/height. Simple ratios performing seeming miracles.
