# Wind Turbines

## Core Insight
Kinetic energy harvesters at massive scale - stealing momentum from atmospheric rivers.

A wind turbine is an energy pickpocket, lifting kinetic energy from moving air. The Betz limit says you can extract maximum 59.3% of wind's kinetic energy - take more and wind stops, flows around instead of through. Modern turbines achieve 45%, impressively close to theoretical maximum.

The power scales with swept area and velocity cubed. Double the wind speed, get eight times the power. This cubic relationship explains why turbines shut down in high winds - too much power would destroy them. It also explains why small increases in average wind speed dramatically improve economics.

Scale matters. A 100-meter rotor sweeps 7,854 m² of sky, intercepting moving air's energy across a circle larger than a football field. Each blade experiences different wind speeds from root to tip, requiring twisted airfoils for optimization.
