# Momentum vs Energy

## Core Insight
Two different measures of motion - one conserved in collisions, both conserved overall.

Momentum (p = mv) and kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²) both describe motion, but they're fundamentally different beasts. Momentum is linear in velocity, energy is quadratic. In collisions, momentum is always conserved, but kinetic energy can transform into other forms.

Watch billiard balls: when the cue ball stops and transfers its motion, momentum passes perfectly. But some kinetic energy becomes sound (the click) and heat (friction). Momentum cares about direction; energy doesn't. You can have zero total momentum but lots of energy (two balls approaching each other).

This distinction puzzled physicists for centuries. Why two quantities? Because the universe conserves different things for different reasons: momentum from spatial symmetry, energy from temporal symmetry. Noether showed us conservation laws arise from symmetries.
