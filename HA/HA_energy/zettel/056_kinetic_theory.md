# Kinetic Theory

## Core Insight
Temperature is molecular motion - heat is the democracy of particle velocities.

The kinetic theory connects microscopic motion to macroscopic temperature. In any gas, molecules zip around at hundreds of meters per second, colliding billions of times per second. Temperature measures their average kinetic energy: ½mv² averaged over countless particles.

This explains everything: pressure (momentum transfer from collisions), diffusion (random walks spreading particles), heat conduction (fast molecules colliding with slow ones). Macroscopic properties emerge from microscopic chaos through statistics.

The beautiful result: temperature has meaning only for collections. One molecule has velocity, not temperature. Ten molecules barely have temperature. But 10²³ molecules definitely have temperature. Properties emerge from populations.
