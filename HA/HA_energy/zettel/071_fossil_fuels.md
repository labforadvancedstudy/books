# Fossil Fuels

## Core Insight
Ancient sunlight compressed into carbon - millions of years of solar energy in concentrated form.

Fossil fuels are time-compressed solar batteries. Coal is 300-million-year-old forests, compressed and cooked. Oil is ancient marine organisms, buried and transformed. Natural gas is the lightweight fraction of this process. All represent photosynthesis from deep time.

The energy density is staggering. A gallon of gasoline contains 31,000 kcal - equivalent to 400 hours of human labor. Coal powered the industrial revolution by releasing Carboniferous sunlight. Oil enabled modern transportation by liquidizing ancient energy.

The carbon problem: we're burning millions of years of stored carbon in centuries, overwhelming the carbon cycle. It's like spending geological savings in human time. The energy was always solar; we just found nature's concentrated storage.
