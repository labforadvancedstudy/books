# Boltzmann Distribution

## Core Insight
Temperature determines energy probability - hot systems explore high energy states.

The Boltzmann distribution is nature's energy democracy. At temperature T, the probability of finding a system in a state with energy E is proportional to e^(-E/kT). Low energy states are always favored, but high temperature makes high energy states accessible.

This simple equation explains everything from chemical reaction rates to stellar fusion. At low T, systems huddle in ground states. At high T, they spread across many states. Temperature is the key that unlocks energy levels.

Life exists because Earth's temperature allows complex molecules to occasionally reach high energy states (for reactions) but mostly stay in low energy states (for stability). Too cold and nothing happens. Too hot and everything falls apart. We live in the Goldilocks zone of the Boltzmann distribution.
