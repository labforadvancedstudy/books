## Core Insight
Chemistry forcing electrons uphill - turning molecular preferences into electrical potential.

A battery is a chemical con game. Zinc wants to dissolve. Copper wants to plate out. But we separate them, forcing electrons to travel through our circuit to complete the reaction. Chemical energy becomes electrical energy because we give chemistry no choice but to push electrons through wires.

Each battery chemistry has its own voltage, determined by how badly the chemicals want to react. Lithium really wants to give up electrons (+3.04V). Lead-acid is less eager (+2.0V). This "eagerness difference" between electrodes creates the electrical pressure we call voltage.

The genius: reactions that would happen violently if mixed (think lithium in water) happen controllably when separated. The same total energy releases, but we get to direct the electron flow through our devices first.
