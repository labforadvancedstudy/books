# Internal Combustion

## Core Insight
Controlled explosions driving pistons - turning chemical violence into mechanical motion.

The internal combustion engine is humanity's bargain with controlled chaos. Inject fuel and air into a cylinder, compress it, spark it, and ride the explosion. The expanding gases push a piston, converting chemical energy to linear motion to rotational motion.

The four-stroke dance: intake (suck), compression (squeeze), combustion (bang), exhaust (blow). Thousands of tiny explosions per minute, each perfectly timed. It's remarkable that such violence can be harnessed so smoothly.

Efficiency peaks around 35% - most energy becomes waste heat. But the energy density of liquid fuels makes this acceptable. A gas tank holds weeks of driving range. No battery comes close. This is why, despite inefficiency, internal combustion dominated the 20th century.
