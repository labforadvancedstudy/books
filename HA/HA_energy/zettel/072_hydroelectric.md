# Hydroelectric

## Core Insight
Gravity and rain conspiring to generate electricity - solar energy laundered through the water cycle.

Hydroelectric power is solar energy in disguise. Sun evaporates ocean water, clouds carry it inland, rain falls on mountains, gravity pulls it down. We intercept this descent, forcing water through turbines, converting gravitational potential to electricity.

A dam is just a gravity battery. Rain charges it, turbines discharge it. The beauty is reliability - unlike wind or direct solar, water behind a dam waits patiently for demand. It's dispatchable renewable energy, available on command.

The scale is breathtaking. Grand Coulee Dam drops water 380 feet, generating 6,800 MW. That's gravitational potential energy converting to kinetic (falling water) to rotational (turbine) to electrical (generator) with 90% efficiency.
