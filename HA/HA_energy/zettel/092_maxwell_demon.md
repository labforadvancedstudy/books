# Maxwell's Demon

## Core Insight
A thought experiment about sorting molecules - revealing information's energy cost.

Maxwell imagined a demon controlling a door between two gas chambers. It lets fast molecules pass one way, slow molecules the other. Eventually one chamber gets hot, the other cold - entropy decreased! The second law violated?

The resolution took a century: information isn't free. The demon must measure each molecule's speed, store that information, and eventually erase it to make room. Landauer showed that erasing information necessarily increases entropy by at least kT ln(2) per bit.

This revealed a profound connection: information is physical. Computation has thermodynamic costs. Every bit erased releases heat. Your computer warms not just from inefficiency but from fundamental information processing limits. Knowledge has an energy price.
