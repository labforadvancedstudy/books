# Complementarity

## Core Insight
Wave and particle descriptions are complementary views - the universe is richer than our categories.

Bohr's complementarity principle: quantum objects have properties that seem contradictory but are actually complementary. Wave and particle aren't opposing truths but partial views of a deeper reality. You see the aspect your measurement probes.

This extends beyond wave-particle duality. Position and momentum are complementary - measuring one precisely destroys information about the other. Energy and time duration are complementary. The universe forces us to choose what to know.

Complementarity suggests reality is fundamentally richer than classical descriptions allow. We're like 2D beings trying to understand a 3D object - we see different projections depending on viewing angle. The full quantum reality transcends our classical categories.
