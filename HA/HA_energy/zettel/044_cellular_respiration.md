# Cellular Respiration

## Core Insight
Life's controlled burn - extracting energy from food without flames.

Cellular respiration is combustion in slow motion. The overall equation (glucose + oxygen → CO₂ + water + energy) is identical to burning sugar. But instead of releasing all energy as heat and light, cells capture it in ATP bonds through a elegant cascade of reactions.

The process reads like a Rube Goldberg machine: glycolysis breaks glucose to pyruvate, the Krebs cycle extracts electrons, the electron transport chain uses those electrons to pump protons, and ATP synthase uses the proton gradient to forge ATP bonds. Complexity serves efficiency.

From one glucose molecule, cells extract 36-38 ATP molecules. Each ATP stores about 7.3 kcal/mol. That's 40% efficiency - better than most engines. The rest becomes heat, keeping us warm-blooded. We're walking furnaces with excellent emission controls.
