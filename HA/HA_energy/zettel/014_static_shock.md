# Static Shock

## Core Insight
Electrons jumping ship - the everyday demonstration of charge separation and reunification.

That tiny zap when you touch a doorknob after shuffling across carpet is lightning's baby cousin. You've become a walking capacitor, accumulating excess electrons stolen from the carpet. The metal doorknob offers an easy path back to electrical neutrality.

Children discover this as a game: rub socks on carpet, touch siblings, laugh at the spark. They're performing electrostatics experiments that would have amazed Benjamin Franklin. The pain is electrons tunneling through air, creating a microscopic lightning bolt.

What's profound is that this requires energy separation first. The work of walking and friction pumps electrons against their will, creating potential. The shock is nature correcting this imbalance with prejudice.
