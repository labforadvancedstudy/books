### Usage Notes

1. Each zettel is designed to be atomic - containing one complete idea in 10-30 lines.

2. Zettels interconnect through conceptual relationships, not just hierarchical placement.

3. Read in any order - each contains a complete thought while building toward the whole.

4. The collection forms a web of understanding about trade as universal principle.

5. New zettels can be added as understanding deepens - the structure is open and evolving.

### Key Insights Across Zettels

- Trade predates money, language, even consciousness
- Every force in physics is a form of exchange
- Consciousness might emerge from trade density
- The universe could be computing through trades
- We are not traders but trades temporarily self-aware

*This zettelkasten is itself a trade - concepts exchanging connections, ideas trading contexts, understanding emerging from the network of relationships. As you read, you participate in this trade, adding your own connections to the eternal exchange.*
