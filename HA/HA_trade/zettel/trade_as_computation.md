# Trade as Computation

## Core Insight
Markets are computers where prices are outputs, trades are operations, and participants are processors solving optimization problems.

Every market computes solutions to resource allocation problems too complex for any central planner. Millions of traders act as distributed processors, each optimizing locally. Price signals propagate like neural impulses. Market equilibrium is computational convergence. Crash is system failure requiring reboot.

Auction theory reveals market algorithms. English auction implements ascending price search. Dutch auction implements descending search. Sealed bid implements parallel processing. Each mechanism computes different aspect of value space. High-frequency trading pushes computation to physical limits - latency is clock speed.

But what is being computed? Perhaps markets calculate society's utility function, solving vast optimization. Or maybe they're Monte Carlo simulations, randomly sampling possibility space. Could consciousness itself be internal market, with neurons trading electrochemical signals to compute experience?
