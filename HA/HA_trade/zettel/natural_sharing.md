# Natural Sharing

## Core Insight
Life inherently shares resources, creating abundance through circulation rather than hoarding.

Observe how life shares: mother's milk flows to infant without invoice, trees share nutrients through mycorrhizal networks, warning of dangers and feeding the weak. Sharing isn't altruism - it's life recognizing itself as interconnected process rather than isolated units.

Hoarding leads to death in nature. The squirrel who forgets buried nuts plants forests. Blood that stops circulating causes necrosis. Water that doesn't flow becomes stagnant. Nature teaches that wealth exists in movement, not accumulation.

Indigenous wisdom recognizes this: resources belong to the community and future generations, not individuals. The salmon returning upstream gift their bodies to forests. Forests gift oxygen to atmosphere. Atmosphere gifts rain to earth. The circle of sharing creates the conditions for life.
