# Trade Singularity

## Core Insight
As trade efficiency approaches perfection and transaction costs approach zero, we might reach a phase transition where reality itself becomes perfectly liquid.

Technological progress reduces trade friction. Barter to money to digital to crypto to smart contracts - each step reducing transaction costs. AI agents will trade at nanosecond scales. Quantum computers might trade in superposition. Brain-computer interfaces could enable thought trading. Where does this lead?

Perhaps to trade singularity - point where exchange becomes frictionless, instantaneous, universal. Every possible trade happens simultaneously. Value discovery becomes perfect. Market becomes omniscient. The economy achieves something like consciousness, or consciousness reveals itself as always having been economic.

This might already have happened. If universe is computational, reality could be output of already-complete cosmic trade optimization. We experience time because consciousness can only process the solved trade matrix sequentially. Free will is choosing which path through predetermined trade space to experience. The singularity isn't coming - we're living inside it.
