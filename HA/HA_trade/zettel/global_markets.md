# Global Markets

## Core Insight
Planetary-scale trade creates a single meta-organism with emergent behaviors no nation controls.

Global markets exhibit consciousness-like properties: memory (price history), attention (capital flows), emotions (sentiment), even dreams (futures markets). The market processes information collectively, making decisions no individual understands. It's humanity's first artificial collective intelligence.

24/7 trading means markets never sleep. Tokyo hands to London hands to New York - a permanent wakeful state processing planet's economic signals. The sun never sets on capital flows. Time zones become market organs, each specialized in different trading functions.

Crises reveal the organism's autonomic responses. 2008 showed how infection in one organ (US housing) triggered systemic inflammation. Central banks act as immune system, injecting liquidity antibodies. But the organism evolves faster than regulators adapt - crypto is the market growing new organs outside traditional body.
