# Exchange Universality

## Core Insight
Exchange is not human invention but cosmic principle - from subatomic to galactic scales, everything trades.

Quarks exchange gluons to create nuclear force. Atoms exchange electrons to form molecules. Molecules exchange energy to enable reactions. Life exchanges matter and energy to maintain organization. Minds exchange ideas to create culture. The universe is built on exchange.

This isn't metaphor but mechanism. Forces are literally particle exchanges in quantum field theory. Photons mediate electromagnetic force. W and Z bosons mediate weak force. Gravitons (theoretically) mediate gravity. Reality's fabric is woven from endless trades happening below perception threshold.

Scale invariance suggests deep pattern. Traders in markets behave like particles in fields. Economic forces resemble physical forces. Perhaps human trade unconsciously mimics universe's operating system. We didn't invent commerce - we discovered local instance of universal principle.
