# Trade Routes

## Core Insight
Trade routes are civilization's neural pathways, carrying not just goods but ideas, genes, and cultural DNA.

The Silk Road wasn't a road but a network - branching, merging, evolving paths connecting East to West. Along with silk flowed Buddhism, algebra, gunpowder, plague. Trade routes are infection vectors for innovation, spreading beneficial mutations across human civilization.

Rivers were first trade routes, teaching humans that flow creates wealth. Cities bloom where rivers meet, where trade routes cross. Geography is destiny because topology determines trade flow. Mountain passes and ocean straits become more valuable than gold mines - controlling flow beats owning stock.

Digital trade routes follow similar patterns. Submarine cables trace ancient shipping lanes. Internet exchange points cluster in trade cities. Even in cyberspace, geography matters - latency is distance, bandwidth is cargo capacity. New trade routes, same network physics.
