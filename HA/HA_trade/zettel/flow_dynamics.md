# Flow Dynamics

## Core Insight
Trade follows fluid dynamics - pressure differentials, viscosity, turbulence all apply to movement of value.

Money flows like water, finding cracks in regulatory dams, pooling in tax havens, evaporating in inflation. Interest rates create pressure differentials. Regulations add viscosity. Market crashes are turbulence. Financial engineering is plumbing - managing flows through complex pipe systems.

In networks, Kirchhoff's laws apply: flow in equals flow out at every node (accounting), and path resistance determines flow distribution (transaction costs). High-frequency trading reduces resistance to near zero, creating new flow patterns. Cryptocurrency removes pipes entirely - value flows like field rather than fluid.

Biological flow teaches efficiency. Blood vessels branch following Murray's Law - optimal diameter ratios minimizing energy cost. River deltas follow same math. Trade networks evolve toward similar optimums - Amazon's distribution centers placed by flow equations, not intuition.
