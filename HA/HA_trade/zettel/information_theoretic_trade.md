# Information Theoretic Trade

## Core Insight
At fundamental level, all trade is information exchange - matter and energy are just currencies for information transfer.

Black hole thermodynamics reveals deep connection. Black holes have entropy proportional to surface area, not volume. Information is fundamental, space-time emergent. When matter falls into black hole, its information is traded to surface, preserved in quantum fluctuations. The universe doesn't destroy information, only trades its form.

Landauer's principle links information to physics: erasing one bit requires minimum energy kT ln(2). Every computation is thermodynamic trade. Thinking burns calories because information processing trades order for heat. Consciousness might be optimal information trader, extracting maximum knowledge per joule.

Quantum information theory suggests ultimate trade limits. No-cloning theorem prevents copying quantum states - information has scarcity even in quantum realm. Quantum teleportation trades entanglement for state transfer. Perhaps universe computes by trading qubits, with reality as output of cosmic quantum algorithm.
