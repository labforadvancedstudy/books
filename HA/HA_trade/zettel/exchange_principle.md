# Exchange Principle

## Core Insight
Every exchange transforms both parties - trade is mutual transformation, not just transfer.

When you trade, you don't just swap objects - you exchange futures. Trading wheat for tools exchanges present food for future productivity. Trading time for money exchanges present energy for future options. Each trade is time travel, moving value across temporal dimensions.

Conservation laws govern exchange. In physics, energy transforms but doesn't disappear. In trade, value transforms but total utility can increase - the bread means more to hungry person than baker with surplus. Trade creates value through reallocation, not creation ex nihilo.

The principle scales: atoms exchange electrons to form molecules. Stars trade light for planetary heat. Galaxies exchange matter through gravitational dance. The universe itself might be one vast exchange system, trading order for entropy, time for space, energy for information.
