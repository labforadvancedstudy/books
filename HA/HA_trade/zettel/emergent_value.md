# Emergent Value

## Core Insight
Value emerges from relationships between traders, not inherent in traded objects - it's a field effect, not particle property.

Water has no inherent value - context creates it. Drowning person values air over gold. Desert traveler values water over diamonds. Value emerges from relationship between need and availability, trader and environment. It's not discovered but created through interaction process.

Network effects demonstrate emergence. Facebook profile worthless alone, valuable in network. Language meaningless in isolation, powerful when shared. Money just paper until collectively believed. Value emerges from collective agreement, shared fiction becoming economic reality through network dynamics.

Quantum mechanics suggests deeper truth. Particles have no definite properties until measured - observation creates reality. Perhaps value similar - not existing until transaction occurs. The act of trading collapses value wave function, creating definite price from probability cloud. Markets are value measurement devices.
