# Symmetry Breaking

## Core Insight
Trade emerges when symmetry breaks - perfect equality has no gradient for exchange to flow.

In perfectly symmetric system, no trade occurs. Why exchange identical items? But break symmetry - create difference in temperature, pressure, concentration - and flow begins. The universe trades because it's asymmetric. Big Bang was ultimate symmetry breaking, creating gradients that still drive cosmic trade.

Economic specialization is symmetry breaking. If everyone equally good at everything, no comparative advantage exists. But variation creates trade opportunities. Individual differences aren't flaws but features - diversity drives exchange. Homogeneous societies stagnate; heterogeneous ones flourish through internal trade.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking creates markets. Mexican wave in stadium - everyone initially sitting (symmetric) until random fluctuation creates wave (broken symmetry). Stock bubbles form similarly - symmetric expectations break when someone starts buying, cascading through system. Markets exist in permanently broken symmetry.
