# Why Exchange

## Core Insight
Exchange exists because isolation is death - the universe trades to avoid maximum entropy equilibrium.

If everything reached perfect equilibrium, universe would experience heat death - maximum entropy, no gradients, no possibility of change. Exchange maintains disequilibrium. Every trade creates local order at cost of global disorder, buying time against thermodynamic inevitability. Life is anti-entropy conspiracy maintained through endless exchange.

But why does universe resist equilibrium? Perhaps existence requires difference. In perfectly uniform cosmos, no observation possible - observer and observed must differ. Exchange maintains necessary asymmetry for universe to experience itself. We trade therefore we are.

Deeper still: maybe exchange is how universe explores possibility space. Each trade samples different configuration, different future. Markets are Monte Carlo simulations of economic possibility. Evolution trades genetic information to explore fitness landscapes. Consciousness trades thoughts to navigate meaning space. Exchange is search algorithm for optimal existence.
