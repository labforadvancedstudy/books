# Information Markets

## Core Insight
In information economy, attention is scarce resource and relevance is currency - data trades for eyeballs.

Google discovered information alchemy: transforming search queries into gold. Users trade personal data for free services. Advertisers trade money for targeted attention. The platform profits from information arbitrage - knowing more about users than users know about themselves.

Prediction markets reveal information's true nature. Iowa Electronic Markets beat polls predicting elections. Traders betting real money aggregate dispersed knowledge better than experts. Price becomes consensus reality - market literally discovers truth through trade mechanics.

Social media created attention stock exchanges. Likes, shares, followers are liquidity metrics. Viral content is IPO. Influence is market cap. But attention markets suffer inflation - ever more extreme content needed for same engagement. The attention economy tends toward outrage because calm doesn't trade.
