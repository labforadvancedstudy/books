# Comparative Advantage

## Core Insight
Trade benefits both parties when each focuses on what they do relatively better, even if one is absolutely better at everything.

The lawyer who types faster than her secretary still benefits from hiring one. Time spent typing is time not spent practicing law. The secretary benefits from employment. Both gain through specialization and trade. This counterintuitive truth drives civilization.

Nature discovered comparative advantage first. In your cells, mitochondria specialize in energy production while ribosomes specialize in protein synthesis. Neither does both. Organs trade specialized functions - heart pumps, lungs breathe, liver filters. The body is a trade federation of specialists.

Nations stumble upon what cells mastered billions of years ago. Portugal's wine and England's cloth, Ricardo's classic example, shows how trade enriches both even when Portugal makes both better. The principle is mathematical, not ideological - it emerges from opportunity cost arithmetic.
