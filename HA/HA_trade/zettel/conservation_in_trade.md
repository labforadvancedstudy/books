# Conservation in Trade

## Core Insight
Nothing is created or destroyed in trade, only transformed - economics obeys physics at deepest level.

Classical economics assumes value creation, but physics knows better. Trade transforms value from one form to another. Potential becomes kinetic. Raw becomes refined. Scattered becomes concentrated. But something is always conserved - energy, momentum, information. Even money obeys conservation when properly accounted.

Double-entry bookkeeping discovered this accidentally. Every debit has credit. Books must balance. Accountants stumbled onto fundamental truth - trade is transformation, not creation. The universe keeps perfect books, balancing energy and entropy across all transactions.

But conservation allows surprising trades. Noether's theorem links conservation laws to symmetries. Time symmetry gives energy conservation. Space symmetry gives momentum conservation. Perhaps economic symmetries create economic conservation laws we haven't discovered yet. What is conserved when markets are efficient?
