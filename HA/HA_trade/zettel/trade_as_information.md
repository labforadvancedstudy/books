# Trade as Information

## Core Insight
Every trade is information transfer - price signals, preference revelation, knowledge exchange encoded in transaction.

When you buy coffee for $5, you broadcast information: coffee worth more than $5 to you, less to seller. Multiply by millions of transactions and market becomes vast information processor, calculating society's distributed preferences in real-time. Price is compressed information.

Trade preceded language as information system. Archaeological evidence shows obsidian trading networks before written records. Objects carried information about distant places, available resources, technological capabilities. Trade goods were humanity's first tweets - spreading memes across continents.

In quantum mechanics, particles "trade" properties through interaction. Measurement is trade - system gives up superposition for definite state. Entanglement is ultimate trade relationship - particles sharing information faster than light. Perhaps all physics is information commerce at smallest scales.
