# Personal Voice

## Core Insight
Voice is the writer's spiritual fingerprint - the unique pattern of choices that makes their writing unmistakably theirs, emerging not from trying to "have a voice" but from the accumulated residue of being.

Voice isn't something you develop; it's something you discover by removing what isn't yours. Beginning writers often sound alike because they're imitating. Mature writers sound unique because they've stopped.

Voice emerges from:
- **Syntax patterns**: How you build sentences naturally
- **Word choices**: Your particular vocabulary and preferences
- **Rhythm**: The music of your prose
- **Concerns**: What you can't stop writing about
- **Blind spots**: What you consistently miss or avoid
- **Personality**: Your way of being in the world

The paradox: The more you try to have a distinctive voice, the more generic you sound. Voice comes from:
1. Writing enormous amounts
2. Reading widely
3. Living deeply
4. Paying attention
5. Giving up on being impressive

Voice is why you can identify a writer from a single paragraph. It's why ghostwriting is difficult. It's why AI writing feels hollow - it has style but no voice, technique but no soul.

Your voice is already there. The work is clearing away everything that obscures it.
