# Typing

## Core Insight
Typing is writing's industrialization - transforming the craft of making letters into mechanized keystroke production, trading the personality of handwriting for the efficiency of standardized output.

The shift from pen to keys changed everything. Speed tripled. Legibility became universal. Editing became possible without rewriting. But something was lost - the direct connection between thought and mark, replaced by the mediation of mechanical action.

Touch typing is a strange skill. Fingers know where letters live without conscious thought. Watch an experienced typist - eyes on screen or closed, fingers dancing independently, translating thought to text at speaking speed. It's almost telepathic, this ability to think words into existence through unconscious finger movements.

QWERTY's layout wasn't designed for efficiency but to slow typists down, preventing mechanical typewriter jams. We're all using a deliberately inefficient system, muscle memory too entrenched to change. Dvorak evangelists preach efficiency, but QWERTY's dominance proves that standards matter more than optimization.

Different keyboards create different writing. Mechanical keyboards with their satisfying clicks encourage rhythm. Laptop keyboards with shallow travel promote brevity. Phone typing with thumbs creates its own grammar - shorter sentences, more typos tolerated, emotions replaced by emoji.

The home row is home indeed. ASDF JKL; - where fingers rest between flights. From this base, they reach for every thought. The pinky, weakest, must stretch for quotation marks and semicolons, making some punctuation literally harder to reach. Keyboard geography shapes what we write.
