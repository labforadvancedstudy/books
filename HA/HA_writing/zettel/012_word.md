# Word

## Core Insight
The word is meaning's atom - the smallest unit of semantic intention, where sound/symbol fuses with sense to create the basic building block of all human communication.

A word is a miracle we've stopped noticing. Arbitrary sounds (spoken) or marks (written) somehow carry meaning from one mind to another. "Tree" - four letters, one syllable - evokes in you everything from childhood climbing to ecological systems. How?

Words exist at the intersection of:
- **Sound/Symbol**: The physical carrier
- **Meaning**: The semantic content  
- **Context**: The situational modifier
- **History**: The etymological ghost
- **Community**: The shared agreement

No word exists alone. Each carries traces of every time it's been used, every context it's appeared in. "Love" means differently after heartbreak. "Home" changes when you're in exile. Words are living things, evolving with use.

The paradox: Words both enable and constrain thought. They give us tools to think with, but also create boundaries. What you cannot name, can you truly think? Yet poets constantly prove words can exceed their definitions, can mean more than they say.

Between writer and reader, words are the courier service of consciousness.
