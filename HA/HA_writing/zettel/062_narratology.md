# Narratology

## Core Insight
Narratology reveals story as a universal cognitive structure - not just entertainment but the fundamental way human consciousness organizes experience into comprehensible sequences of cause, effect, and meaning.

Stories aren't just told; they're how we think. The narrative arc - beginning, middle, end - mirrors how we experience time and causation. We wake (beginning), live the day (middle), sleep (end). Birth, life, death. Setup, conflict, resolution. This isn't cultural; it's cognitive architecture.

Narratology distinguishes story (what happens) from discourse (how it's told). The same story can be told chronologically, in reverse, from multiple viewpoints, in different media. Rashomon demonstrates: same events, different tellings, different meanings. The gap between story and discourse is where art lives.

Every element has function. Characters are agents of action. Settings constrain possibilities. Conflicts drive change. Resolutions restore equilibrium or establish new norms. Even seemingly random details serve narrative purposes - Chekhov's gun principle states if you show a gun in act one, it must fire by act three. Nothing is accidental in narrative.

We can't escape narrative thinking. Even describing static situations, we imply before and after. "The vase sat on the table" suggests it was placed there, might fall. Our brains autocomplete stories from fragments. Show someone a picture; they'll invent what happened before, what happens next. We're compulsive story-making machines.

Narrative shapes identity. We don't have memories; we have stories about our past. These stories, retold and revised, become who we "are." Therapy often involves rewriting personal narratives. History is collective narrative. Religion provides cosmic narrative. Even science tells stories - Big Bang, evolution, heat death. We're narrative all the way down.
