# File Sharing

## Core Insight
File sharing transformed the internet from consumption to participation - everyone became a publisher, distributor, and pirate.

Napster was the earthquake. Suddenly, your music collection was everyone's music collection. Peer-to-peer wasn't just technology but philosophy - why download from one when you can download from many? The network became the server.

The culture changed overnight. "Sharing is caring" met "piracy is theft." A generation grew up believing information wants to be free. Music, movies, software, books - everything digitizable became shareable. The economics of scarcity collapsed.

BitTorrent refined the art. The more popular a file, the faster it downloads. Seeders and leechers, ratios and trackers - a new vocabulary emerged. We learned to leave uploads running, to maintain ratios, to be good citizens of the sharing economy.

Legal alternatives emerged. Dropbox made sharing legitimate. Google Drive, OneDrive, WeTransfer - sanitized sharing for the mainstream. But they're centralized, surveilled, censored. The original P2P dream of uncensorable distribution remains underground.

The lesson endures: once bits can be copied, they will be. No DRM holds forever. No paywall stays unpicked. File sharing revealed a truth the industry still fights - in the digital realm, abundance is natural, scarcity is artificial.
