# Sending Messages

## Core Insight
The "Send" button is modern humanity's most consequential action - irreversible transmission of thought across space and time.

Remember the first email you sent? The anxiety of pressing Send. Once clicked, no taking back. Your words leave your control, travel through invisible networks, appear on someone else's screen. It's telepathy with a paper trail.

The evolution is staggering. Letters took days or weeks. Phone calls happened in real-time but vanished. Email found the middle ground - asynchronous like letters, instant like calls, permanent like neither. We gained speed but lost deniability.

"Message sent" is a peculiar state. Your message exists but hasn't been received. It floats in digital limbo - sent but not seen, delivered but not read. Read receipts added new anxiety. Blue checkmarks became relationship dynamite. We know too much about our messages' journeys.

The psychology shifted. We write differently knowing messages persist. Screenshots make private conversations public. "Delete for everyone" admits the futility - copies exist beyond your control. Every message is potentially eternal, potentially viral.

Yet we can't stop sending. Messages are our new heartbeat - constant, vital, rhythmic. Not sending feels like not breathing. We've evolved to need the ping of connection, the dopamine of replies. Sent messages are our proof of existence in the digital realm.
