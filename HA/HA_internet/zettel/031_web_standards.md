# Web Standards

## Core Insight
Web standards are peace treaties in the browser wars - agreements that allow competing companies to build interoperable technology, creating unity from rivalry.

Without standards, chaos. Imagine if each browser required different HTML. If Google sites only worked in Chrome. If every company invented proprietary protocols. The web would shatter into incompatible islands. Standards are the constitution preventing digital civil war.

The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is the UN of the web. Representatives from companies, universities, governments debate every tag, every API, every feature. Progress is glacial because consensus is hard. But the result is a web that works everywhere.

Standards evolve through realpolitik. HTML5 happened because browser makers implemented features regardless of W3C approval. Standards followed implementation. The "living standard" model acknowledged reality - the web evolves too fast for formal processes.

But standards also stifle. Committee design produces compromises. Bold innovations die in debate. The web's greatest features often came from single actors moving fast - then standardized after proving valuable. Innovation requires rule-breaking.

The miracle: it works. Your HTML works in browsers you've never heard of. Your JavaScript runs on devices that didn't exist when you wrote it. Standards create predictability in unpredictable innovation.
