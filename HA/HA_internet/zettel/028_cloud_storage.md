# Cloud Storage

## Core Insight
Cloud storage is the grand illusion - making you believe your files exist everywhere and nowhere, owned by you but living on someone else's computer.

"The cloud" sounds ethereal, weightless, magical. It's not. It's massive warehouses filled with humming servers, consuming electricity equivalent to small nations. Your vacation photos live in a specific building, on specific drives, backed up to other specific drives. The cloud is brutally physical.

But the abstraction works. Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud - they make geography irrelevant. Your files follow you across devices, across continents. Edit on your phone, continue on laptop, share from tablet. The file exists wherever you are. Omnipresent data.

The trade-off is control. Local files are yours until your drive dies. Cloud files are yours until the company dies, changes terms, gets hacked, or decides you've violated policies. Convenience requires trust. You're renting space in someone else's house.

Yet we can't go back. Collaboration requires cloud. "Email me that file" became "here's the link." Version control happens automatically. Teams edit simultaneously. The cloud enabled workflows impossible with local storage. We're not just storing files - we're storing collaboration itself.
