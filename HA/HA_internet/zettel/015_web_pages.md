# Web Pages

## Core Insight
Web pages are documents that learned to think - static text that became interactive experiences.

A web page seems simple: text, images, maybe some links. But beneath lies revolution. Unlike printed pages, web pages are alive. They respond to clicks, update without reprinting, exist simultaneously for millions of readers. Each viewer might see something different based on their location, history, device.

HTML - HyperText Markup Language - gave text superpowers. Bold wasn't just thick letters but <b>meaning</b>. Links weren't footnotes but portals. Images weren't pasted but referenced. The page became a program pretending to be a document.

Then JavaScript arrived. Pages learned to think. Click a button, the page changes without reloading. Forms validate themselves. Content appears and disappears. The document became an application. We stopped reading pages and started using them.

CSS made pages beautiful. Structure (HTML) separated from presentation (CSS) separated from behavior (JavaScript). The holy trinity of web development. Pages became designed experiences, not just information delivery.

But pages also became heavy. The average web page in 1995: 14KB. Today: 2MB+. We traded simplicity for capability. Pages load dozens of scripts, track every click, phone home constantly. The simple document became a surveillance application.
