# Databases

## Core Insight
Databases are civilization's memory banks - where human knowledge crystallizes into queryable structure, turning information chaos into accessible order.

Before databases, data lived in files. Finding anything meant knowing where to look. Databases inverted this - data lives in one place, queries find what you need. The question "What do we know about X?" became answerable in milliseconds.

SQL became the universal language of questions. SELECT what you want FROM where it lives WHERE conditions match. Every business runs on SQL. Every website queries databases. We encoded human curiosity into syntax.

But relational databases assumed structure. Tables, rows, columns - everything had its place. Then came web scale. MongoDB said "just store documents." Redis said "just store key-values." Graph databases said "just store relationships." NoSQL wasn't anti-SQL but post-SQL.

The CAP theorem revealed truth: you can have Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance - pick two. Physics limits even databases. This forced architectural choices. Your database philosophy determines your application's reality.

Modern databases are time machines. They version everything, store history, enable "what did we know on Tuesday?" queries. We're not just storing data but storing time itself. Databases became memory and history combined.
