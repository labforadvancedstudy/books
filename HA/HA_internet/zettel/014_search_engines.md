# Search Engines

## Core Insight
Search engines are humanity's first successful attempt at omniscience - ask any question, receive instant answers from the sum of human knowledge.

Before search, the web was dark. You navigated by memory, bookmarks, or links. Yahoo tried organizing sites into categories like a phone book. Then Google realized: don't organize the web, index it. Make everything searchable. Let algorithms sort relevance.

The search box became our oracle. Type symptoms, get diagnosis. Type questions, get answers. Type names, get histories. We stopped memorizing because we could always search. Google became a verb, a reflex, an extension of memory itself.

PageRank was the breakthrough - pages important if important pages link to them. Recursive authority. The web voting on itself. This simple insight made Google dominant. Not just finding pages but finding the right pages. Quality through democracy of links.

But search shaped the web in return. SEO - Search Engine Optimization - became an industry. Sites contorted themselves to please algorithms. Content farms bloomed. The web began writing for robots, not humans. We optimized ourselves for our tool.

Now we don't even type searches. Voice search, image search, predictive search. The engine knows what we want before we do. Search isn't finding anymore - it's being guided by an intelligence that knows the web better than any human ever could.
