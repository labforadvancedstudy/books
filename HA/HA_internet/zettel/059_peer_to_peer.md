# Peer to Peer

## Core Insight
Peer-to-peer is the internet's original dream - every node equal, no masters or servants, pure digital democracy that keeps trying to emerge despite corporate capture.

P2P inverts power. Instead of downloading from central servers, download from everyone. Instead of one source of truth, distributed consensus. Napster showed the model. BitTorrent perfected it. The more popular content becomes, the faster it spreads. Abundance from sharing.

But P2P threatens control. Record labels fought Napster. Governments fear Tor. Corporations prefer client-server where they're the server. P2P means no central point to control, monitor, monetize. It's architecturally anarchist.

Blockchain revived P2P philosophy. No central bank, just distributed ledger. No company storing data, just global replication. The dream of ungovernable systems, censorship-resistant networks, power truly distributed. Whether it delivers remains uncertain.

The technical challenges are real. P2P is slower than centralized. Coordination is harder. Free riders proliferate. NAT makes most devices unreachable. Mobile devices come and go. The internet's architecture evolved against P2P.

Yet P2P persists because the dream persists. Every generation rediscovers it. Napster to BitTorrent to Bitcoin to IPFS. The pattern repeats: brief flourishing, corporate/government pushback, underground survival, renaissance with new technology. P2P is the internet's recurring dream of freedom.
