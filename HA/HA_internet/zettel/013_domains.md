# Domains

## Core Insight
Domain names are digital real estate where location is reputation and addresses build empires.

Before domains, we had IP addresses - numbers like 192.168.1.1. Imagine telling someone to visit 93.184.216.34 instead of example.com. Domain names gave the internet a human face, turning numbers into names, math into meaning.

The gold rush was real. In the 1990s, people registered dictionary words, company names, anything valuable. Pizza.com sold for $2.6 million. Business.com for $7.5 million. Single words became worth fortunes because domains are unique - only one pizza.com exists in the universe.

The hierarchy matters. .com means commercial, .org means organization, .edu means education. These Top Level Domains (TLDs) carry cultural weight. A .com feels more legitimate than a .biz. A .edu email address opens doors. The suffix shapes perception.

Subdomains create infinite namespace. Blog.example.com, shop.example.com, api.example.com - each subdomain is a new space under your control. Big sites become cities with districts. Amazon has hundreds of subdomains for different services.

Domain names are power. Losing your domain means losing your identity, your traffic, your business. Domain hijacking, expiration, disputes - these aren't technical issues but existential threats. Your domain is your name in the digital world, and names have power.
