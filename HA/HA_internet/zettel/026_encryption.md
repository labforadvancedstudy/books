# Encryption

## Core Insight
Encryption is mathematics performing magic - turning meaningful messages into meaningless noise, then back again, keeping secrets in a world of copycats.

Before encryption, the internet was a postcard system. Every packet readable by anyone along the path. Your ISP, their ISP, backbone providers, governments - all could read your data. Privacy was politeness, not protection.

Public key cryptography solved the impossible. How do strangers share secrets? Alice publishes a public key (lock). Bob encrypts with it. Only Alice's private key (key) can decrypt. They've never met, never shared secrets, yet communicate privately. Math defeats eavesdroppers.

HTTPS everywhere changed the web. The padlock icon meant safety. Credit cards, passwords, messages - all wrapped in mathematical protection. Encryption became invisible infrastructure. We stopped thinking about it, which means it worked.

But encryption is political. Governments want backdoors. "Going dark" they cry, as criminals use math they can't break. The crypto wars continue - should perfect privacy exist? Can democracy survive when anyone can keep absolute secrets?

End-to-end encryption raised stakes. WhatsApp, Signal - not even the companies can read your messages. Privacy becomes absolute. Dissidents rejoice. Governments rage. Math doesn't care about politics. The equations protect everyone equally.
