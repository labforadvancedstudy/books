# HTML

## Core Insight
HTML is humanity's first universal language - not for human-to-human but human-to-machine communication.

HyperText Markup Language started simple. <p> for paragraph, <h1> for heading, <a> for anchor (link). Tim Berners-Lee designed it for physicists sharing papers. He couldn't imagine it would structure all human knowledge.

The beauty is its forgiveness. Forget to close a tag? Browser figures it out. Typo in an attribute? Page still loads. This tolerance enabled amateur publishing. You didn't need perfection, just good enough. The web grew because HTML forgave our mistakes.

Semantic HTML emerged. Tags gained meaning beyond appearance. <article>, <nav>, <footer> - structure with purpose. Screen readers could understand. Search engines could parse. HTML became not just presentation but communication of intent.

The simplicity hides profundity. Every web page is human-readable source code. Right-click, "View Source," see how it's made. No other medium offers this transparency. The web teaches itself. Every page is both creation and instruction.

HTML5 made it an application platform. <canvas> for graphics, <video> for media, <audio> for sound. Local storage, geolocation, offline apps. The document language learned to build programs. HTML became the universal user interface.
