# Server Client

## Core Insight
Server-client architecture is digital feudalism - powerful servers providing services to dependent clients, creating hierarchies of capability and control.

The relationship seems simple: clients ask, servers answer. Your browser (client) requests a page, web server delivers it. But this simplicity hides power dynamics. Servers have what clients need. Servers set terms. Clients comply or disconnect.

Originally, the internet was peer-to-peer. Every computer could be both client and server. But asymmetric internet connections (fast download, slow upload) and NAT made most devices client-only. We became digital peasants, consuming but not providing.

The architecture shapes society. Cloud services are server supremacy - they compute, store, decide; we just display results. "Thin clients" was the dream/nightmare - powerless devices totally dependent on servers. Your smartphone is powerful but still mostly asks servers for permission.

Yet clients rebel. BitTorrent makes every downloader an uploader. Blockchain eliminates central servers. Edge computing pushes power back to devices. The pendulum swings between centralization and distribution, control and freedom.

The deepest truth: in server-client, we encoded human relationships. Master-servant. Provider-consumer. Authority-subject. The architecture isn't neutral - it's political.
