# Navigation

## Core Insight
Web navigation is humanity learning to fly through information space - we developed wings made of clicks and searches.

Back button. Forward button. Home. These simple controls became our compass for the infinite. The browser's navigation bar is our cockpit for piloting through cyberspace. We learned its language instinctively - back retraces steps, refresh reloads reality, home returns to safety.

But web navigation broke physical metaphors. You can be in multiple places simultaneously (tabs). You can teleport instantly (bookmarks). You can search for places you've never been (Google). Traditional wayfinding collapsed into something new.

The breadcrumb trail emerged - showing your path through site hierarchies. Site.com > Products > Electronics > Phones. Each step clickable, each level accessible. We learned to think in trees and hierarchies, understanding position through relationship.

Then mobile changed everything. No mouse, no hover states, just fingers on glass. Navigation condensed into hamburger menus, bottom bars, gestures. Swipe back replaced the back button. Pull down to refresh. The physical and digital merged through touch.

We've internalized navigation so deeply we feel lost without it. A site with broken navigation feels broken entirely. We need to know where we are, where we've been, where we can go. Navigation isn't just UI - it's psychological safety in the infinite space.
