# Social Media

## Core Insight
Social media transformed the internet from library to party - where everyone talks at once and algorithms decide who gets heard.

Web 2.0 promised democratization. Everyone's a publisher! Your blog awaits! But blogging required effort. Social media removed friction. Type thought, hit post, done. The barrier to publishing approached zero. Quantity exploded. Quality... varied.

The feed became our new reality. Endless scroll, algorithmic curation. Not chronological but "relevant." The algorithm knows what you want better than you do. It feeds you more of what you engage with. Anger gets clicks. Division drives engagement. The feed feeds on itself.

Social graphs mapped human relationships. Friends, followers, connections - relationships became data. Six degrees of separation became searchable. Privacy evaporated. Your network reveals you. Metadata is data. The graph knows all.

Influence metrics gamified humanity. Likes, shares, followers - scores for existence. People optimize for metrics, becoming brands. Authenticity becomes performance. The metrics shape behavior. We become what we measure.

Yet social media connects. Arab Spring, #MeToo, movements born in hashtags. Families across oceans stay close. Communities form around interests, not geography. The same tool that divides also unites. It's not the medium but how we use it.
