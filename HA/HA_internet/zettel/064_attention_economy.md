# Attention Economy

## Core Insight
The attention economy treats human consciousness as strip-minable resource - extracting focus and selling it to the highest bidder.

Economics assumes scarcity. In the information age, information is abundant. What's scarce? Attention. You have ~16 waking hours, maybe 8 of deep focus. That's your daily attention budget. Everyone wants a piece.

The extraction mechanisms evolved. Pop-ups were crude. Infinite scroll is elegant. Variable reward schedules (like slot machines) maximize engagement. Red notification dots trigger checking behavior. Dark patterns guide you deeper. Your attention is the product being optimized for.

Free services aren't free. You pay with attention, which becomes data, which becomes targeting, which becomes influence. The business model is behavior modification at scale. Advertisers don't want your money directly - they want to reprogram your desires.

The cost is cognitive. Fractured attention, shortened focus, dopamine dysregulation. We're training our brains for distraction. Deep work becomes impossible. Books feel slow. Reality disappoints. The attention economy leaves us rich in stimulation, poor in satisfaction.

Fighting back requires discipline. Ad blockers, notification management, digital sabbaths. But individual resistance faces systematic extraction. It's like dieting in a candy store. The environment is engineered against you.
