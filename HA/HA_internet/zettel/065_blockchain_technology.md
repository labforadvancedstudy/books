# Blockchain Technology

## Core Insight
Blockchain is trust without trustees - a mathematical solution to human faithlessness, enabling cooperation between entities that don't trust each other.

The problem was ancient: how do you transfer value without intermediaries? Banks exist because strangers don't trust each other. Governments exist to enforce contracts. Blockchain said: what if math could replace trust?

The solution is elegant: a chain of blocks, each containing transactions, each linked cryptographically to the previous. Change history? You must recompute everything after. The longer the chain, the more immutable the past. Time becomes an ally of truth.

But blockchain is inefficient by design. Every node stores everything. Consensus requires massive computation. Bitcoin uses more electricity than Argentina. We're burning coal to maintain distributed ledgers. The environmental cost of trustlessness is steep.

The hype exceeded reality. "Blockchain will revolutionize everything!" became "blockchain might improve some things." Most proposed uses don't need decentralization's costs. A database works fine when parties trust each other. Blockchain solves specific problems, not all problems.

Yet the innovation is real. Digital scarcity became possible. Smart contracts execute without intermediaries. Entire financial systems run on mathematics. We proved trust isn't necessary for cooperation - just cryptographic verification.
