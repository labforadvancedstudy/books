# Cookies

## Core Insight
Cookies gave the stateless web memory - transforming anonymous visits into persistent relationships.

HTTP is forgetful. Each request stands alone, no memory of previous interactions. This was fine for static pages but useless for shopping carts, logins, preferences. Cookies solved this by leaving crumbs - small text files that browsers send back with each request.

The name is perfect. Like Hansel and Gretel leaving cookie crumbs to find their way back, websites leave cookies to remember your path. "Remember me" checkboxes, shopping carts that persist, language preferences - all powered by these tiny text files.

But cookies evolved from convenience to surveillance. First-party cookies (from sites you visit) seemed benign. Third-party cookies (from advertisers) created shadow profiles. Visit a shoe store, see shoe ads everywhere. The innocent cookie became a tracking device.

The cookie banner plague emerged. "This site uses cookies" - click accept or leave. GDPR and privacy laws forced disclosure, but users just click through. We traded privacy for convenience, one click at a time. The warning became wallpaper.

Now cookies are dying. Safari and Firefox block third-party cookies. Chrome promised to follow. The web must relearn how to remember without stalking. But something will replace cookies - the need for persistent identity is too strong. The web wants to remember.
