# Hyperlinks

## Core Insight
Hyperlinks are teleportation made real - they collapse the distance between any two ideas to zero.

Tim Berners-Lee didn't invent the link, but he made it universal. Before hyperlinks, references were promises: "See page 47." You had to work to follow them. Hyperlinks made references instant. Click and you're there. No page flipping, no library visits, no waiting.

The hyperlink is deceptively simple: text that points elsewhere. But this simplicity enables complexity. Every page can reference every other page. The result isn't a book but a web - hence "World Wide Web." Knowledge becomes non-linear, explorable in any direction.

Links create the internet's topology. Without them, we'd have isolated islands of information. With them, we have a neural network of human knowledge. Every link is a synapse, every click a thought jumping between neurons.

The power dynamics are real. Getting linked to matters. PageRank algorithm realized this: a link is a vote. Important pages link to important pages. Links create hierarchy, authority, wealth. The humble hyperlink structures the entire digital economy.

But links also decay. Link rot - when destinations disappear - reveals the web's fragility. We're building on sand, constantly shifting. The permanent web is an illusion maintained by continuous effort.
