# Platform Dominance

## Core Insight
Platform dominance is digital feudalism - a few lords controlling the land where billions of digital serfs live, work, and play.

The internet began decentralized. Anyone could run a server, host a site, be a peer. Then platforms emerged. Facebook for friends. Google for search. Amazon for shopping. Convenient centralization. We traded freedom for features.

Network effects created monopolies. Social networks need everyone there. Marketplaces need all buyers and sellers. Search needs all information. The more users, the more value, the more users. Winner-takes-all wasn't policy but physics.

Platforms became governments. They write rules (terms of service), enforce laws (content moderation), levy taxes (fees), control borders (banning). But unlike governments, no democracy. Benevolent dictatorships at best, extractive empires at worst.

The API giveth and taketh away. Build on our platform! Use our data! Until you're too successful. Then APIs close, terms change, competitors crushed. Twitter killed its ecosystem. Facebook cloned competitors. Platforms fear platforms.

Decentralization fights back. Mastodon, Matrix, IPFS - protocols not platforms. Own your data, choose your server, no single point of control. But convenience wins. Most choose the easy cage over the difficult freedom.
