# HTTP Protocol

## Core Insight
HTTP is the internet's universal language of request and response - enabling billions of computers to communicate without knowing each other's inner workings.

HyperText Transfer Protocol sounds complex but it's beautifully simple. Client asks: "GET /page.html". Server responds: "200 OK, here's your page." This simplicity enabled the web. Any device speaking HTTP could join the conversation.

The statelessness was genius. Each request stands alone, no memory required. This made HTTP scalable - servers don't track conversations, just answer questions. One server could handle thousands of clients because each interaction was independent.

Status codes became cultural. "404 Not Found" entered common language. "200 OK" means success. "500 Internal Server Error" means panic. "301 Moved Permanently" means the web is fluid. These numbers carry meaning beyond protocol.

HTTPS added the S for Secure. Encryption wrapped around HTTP, making private conversation possible. The padlock icon became trust symbol. Banking, shopping, messaging - all possible because HTTP learned to keep secrets.

HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 evolved the protocol without breaking it. Multiplexing, server push, header compression - optimizations invisible to users. The web got faster while speaking the same language. Evolution, not revolution.
