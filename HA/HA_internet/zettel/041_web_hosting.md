# Web Hosting

## Core Insight
Web hosting companies are digital landlords - renting out server space where websites live, controlling who gets to exist online and under what conditions.

Every website needs a home. Not metaphorically - literally. Physical servers in physical buildings with physical addresses. Web hosts own these digital apartments, renting them by the month. Your website is just a tenant, subject to terms of service thicker than most legal documents.

Shared hosting is the tenement of the internet. Hundreds of sites crammed on one server, fighting for resources. One bad neighbor running terrible code? Everyone suffers. It's cheap because it's crowded. You get what you pay for: an address, not a guarantee of performance.

The power dynamics are stark. Host doesn't like your content? Evicted. Forgot to pay? Deleted. Violated some obscure term? Gone. Your online presence exists at their pleasure. They're not just landlords - they're judges with the power to make you digitally homeless.

But hosting evolved. VPS, dedicated servers, cloud hosting - each step up the ladder means more control, more cost, more complexity. The ultimate freedom? Running your own servers. The ultimate headache? Running your own servers. Most choose dependence over independence.
