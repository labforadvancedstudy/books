# Games as Art

## Core Insight
The eighth art form emerges - where interactivity transforms aesthetic experience from observation to participation.

The old debate: can games be art? Wrong question. Games aren't trying to be art - they're expanding what art can be. Traditional art is received. Game art is co-created. The player isn't audience but collaborator, not viewer but performer.

Games create aesthetics impossible in other media. The beauty of a perfectly executed combo. The tragedy of a permanent choice. The sublime terror of being hunted. These aren't representations of experiences - they ARE experiences, crafted and curated but lived uniquely each time.

When games embrace their gameness - when they explore what only interactivity can express - they achieve artistic heights. Not despite being games, but because they are games. The art isn't in looking like film or reading like literature. It's in being what only games can be.
