# Emergent Gameplay

## Core Insight
When systems interact, they birth behaviors their creators never imagined - the ghost in the machine is creativity itself.

Rocket jumping wasn't designed. It emerged. Players discovered that shooting rockets at their feet while jumping launched them higher. A physics bug became a feature, a technique, a skill to master. This is emergence: when game systems combine in unexpected ways.

Minecraft: simple blocks, infinite creations. Grand Theft Auto: city simulation becomes playground. Speedrunning: games played "wrong" become new games entirely. Players are co-designers, finding fun in the spaces between intended mechanics.

Emergence teaches humility to designers. You create possibilities, not experiences. Players create experiences. The best games are instruments, not songs.
