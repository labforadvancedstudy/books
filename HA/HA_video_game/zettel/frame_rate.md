# Frame Rate

## Core Insight
The frequency of existence in digital worlds - where time itself is quantized into discrete moments of being.

30 FPS. 60 FPS. 144 FPS. These aren't just numbers - they're the rhythm of virtual reality. Below 24 FPS, the illusion breaks. We see the discreteness. Above 60 FPS, most humans can't consciously perceive the difference, yet they feel it - in response time, in smoothness, in that indefinable quality called "game feel."

Frame rate is where hardware meets perception. It's the contract between machine and mind: "I will show you this many slices of time per second, and you will perceive motion." Too few slices, and the magic fails. Too many, and we waste computation on the imperceptible.

The history of gaming is partly a history of frame rate optimization - the eternal struggle to do more in less time.
