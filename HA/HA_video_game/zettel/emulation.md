# Emulation

## Core Insight
Machines dreaming they are other machines - where software becomes a time machine for digital experiences.

Emulation is technological séance. We resurrect dead hardware in software, teaching modern computers to pretend they're ancient consoles. Every cycle counted, every quirk replicated. It's not enough to run the game - you must become the machine that ran the game.

Why this obsession with perfect reproduction? Because games aren't just software - they're experiences tied to specific hardware. The way sprites flicker on NES. The exact timing of SNES sound. These aren't bugs - they're the texture of memory.

Emulation is preservation and transformation. It saves games from physical decay while fundamentally changing them. A game running on original hardware versus emulation - same code, different reality. Which is the "real" experience?
