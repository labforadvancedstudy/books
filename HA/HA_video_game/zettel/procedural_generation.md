# Procedural Generation

## Core Insight
Algorithms as creators - where code becomes co-designer and randomness becomes authored experience.

Procedural generation is humanity's attempt to encode creativity itself. Not creating content, but creating rules that create content. Each playthrough of Minecraft spawns a unique world. No Man's Sky promises 18 quintillion planets. Roguelikes offer infinite dungeons.

But randomness isn't creativity. The art lies in constraints. Good procedural generation creates possibility spaces where most outcomes are interesting. It's curated randomness, authored unpredictability. The designer creates the grammar; the algorithm writes the sentences.

It asks profound questions: can creativity be algorithmic? Is discovery different when exploring human-designed versus computer-generated spaces? When we explore procedural worlds, what are we really exploring?
