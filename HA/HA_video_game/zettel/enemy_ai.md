# Enemy AI

## Core Insight
The illusion of mind in mindless machines - where simple rules create the appearance of intention, strategy, and malice.

Pac-Man's ghosts aren't smart. Blinky always chases. Pinky aims ahead. Inky is unpredictable. Clyde does his own thing. Four simple algorithms, but together they create the illusion of a coordinated hunt. This is the magic of game AI: not to be intelligent, but to seem intelligent.

From pattern-based movement to finite state machines to behavior trees to neural networks - the evolution of enemy AI mirrors our growing ambition to create convincing others in our digital worlds. Yet often, the simplest AI is the most fun. Players need to read intention, predict behavior. Too complex, and enemies become noise. Too simple, and they become furniture.

Enemy AI teaches us: intelligence is performance. What matters isn't what the enemy thinks, but what the player thinks the enemy thinks.
