# Glitch

## Core Insight
The ghost in the machine made visible - where code's hidden assumptions surface as impossible realities.

Glitches are windows into the constructed nature of digital worlds. When Mario falls through the floor, when textures corrupt, when physics break - we see the simulation's seams. Every glitch is a reminder: this world is made of rules, and rules can fail.

But glitches became more than failures. They became features. Combos in Street Fighter started as a bug. Rocket jumping was unintended. Entire speedrunning categories exist to exploit glitches. Players turned broken into beautiful.

The glitch aesthetic - corrupted graphics, impossible geometries, reality tears - became its own art movement. Glitch art celebrates the failure modes of digital systems. It finds beauty in breakdown, meaning in malfunction.
