# Power-Up

## Core Insight
Temporary transcendence made tangible - where collecting an object transforms identity and capability.

The Super Mushroom. The Fire Flower. The Star. Power-ups are gaming's promise: you can become more than you are. Touch this floating, spinning object and transform. Grow larger. Shoot fire. Become invincible. For 15 seconds, you are a god.

Power-ups externalize growth. Instead of grinding statistics, you grab transformation. It's immediate, visceral, temporary. This temporariness is crucial - permanent power becomes new normal. Temporary power remains special.

The psychology is primal: see shiny thing, grab shiny thing, feel powerful. It taps into gathering instincts, reward circuits, power fantasies. Every power-up collected is a small victory, a brief taste of what could be.
