# Collision Detection

## Core Insight
The mathematics of touch in untouchable worlds - where geometry determines consequence.

In physical reality, objects cannot occupy the same space. In digital reality, they can - unless we prevent it. Collision detection is the enforcement of physics in a world that has none.

Every frame, we ask: do these rectangles overlap? Do these circles intersect? Does this ray hit that polygon? Simple questions with complex implications. Without collision detection, Mario falls through floors, bullets pass through enemies, games become meaningless.

It's computationally expensive to be solid. That's why early games used simple bounding boxes. That's why modern games use hierarchical spatial partitioning. The history of collision detection is the history of making the impossible (perfect physical simulation) acceptably approximate.
