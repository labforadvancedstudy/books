# Lives System

## Core Insight
Arcade economics disguised as game mechanic - where capitalism shaped the fundamental metaphor of digital death and rebirth.

Three lives. Why three? Because one quarter should give you enough play to feel satisfied but not so much that the arcade owner goes broke. The lives system is economic design dressed as game design.

But it became more. Lives taught us video game death was temporary. Unlike life, unlike most games before, failure wasn't final. You could try again. And again. This retry mechanic - born from coin-ops - became fundamental to how we think about challenge, progress, and failure in games.

The 1-Up mushroom. The extra life at 10,000 points. These aren't just rewards - they're promises of continued existence, second chances, hope quantified.
