# Button Press

## Core Insight
The quantum of interaction - where human intention collapses into binary certainty: pressed or not pressed.

A button press is the smallest unit of agency in digital worlds. Before gaming, buttons meant utility: elevators, phones, machines. Gaming transformed buttons into language. A becomes jump. B becomes shoot. Combinations become words, sequences become sentences.

The physicality matters. The click of microswitches. The resistance of springs. The travel distance before activation. These millimeters and milliseconds separate responsive from mushy, precise from vague. Great games begin with great buttons.

Every gaming generation has its iconic button. Space bar for PC. A button for Nintendo. X for PlayStation. These aren't just inputs - they're cultural touchstones.
