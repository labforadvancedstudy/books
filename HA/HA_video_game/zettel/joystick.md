# Joystick

## Core Insight
The first intuitive bridge between human intention and digital action - translating physical movement into virtual control.

The joystick represents humanity's first successful attempt to create natural control over digital spaces. Unlike keyboards (designed for text), the joystick was born for movement. Push forward, go forward. Simple. Intuitive. Revolutionary.

From Atari's single-button stick to modern analog controllers, the principle remains: physical displacement maps to virtual displacement. It's proprioception extended into digital realms.
