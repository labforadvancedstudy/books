# Game Balance

## Core Insight
The art of crafting fairness in artificial worlds - where mathematics meets psychology to create the illusion of equal opportunity.

Balance is a lie games tell to feel fair. Perfect balance is impossible - and undesirable. Rock-paper-scissors is perfectly balanced and perfectly boring. Good balance creates tension, trade-offs, meaningful choices. It's not about making all options equal, but making all options viable.

Starcraft: three races, asymmetrically balanced. Street Fighter: dozens of characters, each with strengths and weaknesses. League of Legends: perpetual rebalancing as players discover new strategies. Balance isn't a state, it's a process.

Balance reveals game design's central paradox: players want fairness but need imbalance. They want to win by skill but also by discovering the overpowered strategy. Balance is the tightrope walk between these contradictions.
