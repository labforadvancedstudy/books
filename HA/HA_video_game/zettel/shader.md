# Shader

## Core Insight
Poetry for GPUs - tiny programs that paint reality pixel by pixel, transforming mathematics into light.

Shaders democratized visual effects. Before: fixed-function pipelines, limited options. After: programmable pixels, infinite possibility. Every modern game's visual identity lives in its shaders. The way light scatters through skin. The shimmer of water. The blur of speed. All shaders.

Written in languages like GLSL or HLSL, shaders are parallel programs running on thousands of cores simultaneously. Each pixel calculated independently, yet together forming coherent images. It's massively parallel poetry.

Shaders reveal the constructed nature of digital imagery. Every pixel is calculated, decided, authored. There are no accidents in digital light - only algorithms pretending to be nature.
