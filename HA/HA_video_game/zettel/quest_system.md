# Quest System

## Core Insight
Purpose manufactured and packaged - where games create meaning through structured tasks and artificial urgency.

"Collect 10 wolf pelts." "Deliver this letter." "Kill the bandit leader." Quests are gaming's answer to existential aimlessness. In worlds where you can do anything, quests tell you what you should do. They transform sandboxes into stories.

The brilliance of quests: they layer narrative onto mechanics. Killing wolves becomes meaningful when it's for the village elder. Walking becomes adventure when you're delivering crucial information. The same actions, recontextualized, gain weight.

Modern quest design wrestles with automation. Markers point the way. Journals track progress. The mystery is automated out. Yet players crave this structure. Freedom is paralysing; quests are liberating. They answer gaming's fundamental question: "What now?"
