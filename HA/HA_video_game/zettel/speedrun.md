# Speedrun

## Core Insight
Playing games wrong as an art form - where mastery transcends intention and players become archaeologists of unintended possibility.

Speedrunning inverts the relationship between player and game. The game is no longer entertainment to be consumed but a system to be deconstructed, optimized, broken. Every frame counts. Every pixel matters. Every glitch is a tool.

Watch a speedrun of a game you love. It's like seeing a familiar painting revealed as a machine. Mario isn't jumping through a world - he's manipulating memory addresses. Link isn't on an adventure - he's executing arbitrary code through controller inputs.

Speedrunning creates new games within games. Any%, 100%, glitchless - each category a different discipline. It's competitive archaeology, collaborative deconstruction. Players working together to work against the game.
