# Game Engine

## Core Insight
The machine that builds machines - a reality generator that transforms human imagination into interactive experience.

A game engine is crystallized expertise. Thousands of solved problems - rendering, physics, audio, input, memory management - packaged into reusable form. It's the difference between painting and making paint. Between telling stories and inventing language.

Unity, Unreal, Godot - these aren't just tools. They're philosophical statements about how games should be made. They encode assumptions, enable certain experiences, prevent others. Choose an engine, and you choose constraints. But constraints breed creativity.

The engine abstracts complexity so creators can focus on creation. It's civilization in code form - standing on the shoulders of giants who figured out quaternion rotation so you don't have to.
