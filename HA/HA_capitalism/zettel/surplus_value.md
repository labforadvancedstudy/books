# Surplus Value

## Core Insight
The unpaid labor time that workers give to capitalists - the secret source of all profit, rent, and interest in capitalism.

The magic trick revealed: You work 8 hours but produce enough value to cover your wage in 4. Those extra 4 hours? That's surplus value, appropriated by capital.

This is not theft in the legal sense - the wage contract is "fair" by market standards. It's theft in a deeper sense: the systematic extraction of life-time from those who must sell it to those who can buy it.

Every fortune is built on millions of unpaid hours. Every billionaire is a monument to extracted surplus.
