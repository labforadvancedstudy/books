# Creative Destruction

## Core Insight
Capitalism's process of continuous self-revolution where innovation destroys existing industries and ways of life - progress as perpetual catastrophe.

The blacksmith's forge becomes scrap metal. The typing pool vanishes into software. Entire cities rust. This is creative destruction: capitalism eating itself to grow.

Schumpeter saw it as capitalism's glory - eternal innovation! Marx saw deeper: it's capital fleeing the tendency of profit to fall, desperately seeking new territories of value.

The human cost is "externalized": communities destroyed, skills obsoleted, lives upended. All sacrificed to the god of efficiency.

The bitter irony: we destroy perfectly functional systems not because they don't work, but because they don't generate enough profit.
