# Alienation

## Core Insight
The systematic separation of humans from their labor, products, fellow humans, and own essence - capitalism's psychic tax on the soul.

You make things you'll never use, for people you'll never meet, using skills that numb your mind, to earn money to buy things you don't need. This is alienation: being a stranger in your own life.

Four dimensions of estrangement:
1. From the product (you make it but don't own it)
2. From the process (work feels like dying time)
3. From others (competition replaces cooperation)
4. From self (you become what the market needs)

The deepest violence of capitalism: making us strangers to ourselves.
