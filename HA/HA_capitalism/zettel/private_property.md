# Private Property

## Core Insight
The legal and social framework that allows individuals or entities to exclude others from use of resources - the bedrock upon which capitalism stands.

Not just "this is mine" but "I can stop you from using this, even if I'm not using it myself." Private property transforms the world into a grid of exclusions.

Crucially different from personal property (your toothbrush, your clothes). Private property typically means productive property - the factory, the land, the algorithm, the patent. Things that could create wealth if others could access them.

The magic trick: convincing everyone that this exclusion is natural, eternal, and just.
