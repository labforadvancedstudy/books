# Commodity Fetishism

## Core Insight
The mystical process by which social relations between people appear as relations between things - capitalism's foundational magic trick that makes its power invisible.

Your phone seems smart. Money seems powerful. Brands have personalities. Meanwhile, the actual humans who made these things vanish. This is commodity fetishism: dead things appear alive while living beings become things.

The fetish works because it's partially true - in capitalism, things DO have social power. Your access to commodities determines your access to life. But we forget: we gave them this power. We can take it back.

The deepest ideological operation: making the social appear natural, the historical appear eternal, the changeable appear fixed.
