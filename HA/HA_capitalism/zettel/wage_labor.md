# Wage Labor

## Core Insight
The transformation of human time and energy into a commodity that can be bought and sold - the foundation of capitalism's class structure.

You wake up, not because you want to, but because you must sell your hours to survive. This is wage labor: the peculiar arrangement where those who own tools buy the time of those who don't.

Unlike the serf bound to land or the slave owned outright, the wage laborer is "free" - free to sell their labor power, free to starve if they don't. This freedom is capitalism's cruel joke and crowning achievement.

The wage relation creates two classes:
- Those who buy labor power (capitalists)
- Those who sell it (workers)

Everything else follows from this split.
