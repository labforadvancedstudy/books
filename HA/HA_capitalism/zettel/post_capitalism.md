# Post-Capitalism

## Core Insight
The emerging possibility of a system beyond capitalism, made necessary by ecological limits and enabled by technological abundance - not a return to the past but an escape to the future.

Post-capitalism isn't a utopian dream but a material necessity:
- Capitalism requires infinite growth on a finite planet
- Automation eliminates jobs faster than it creates them
- Digital goods break the scarcity logic of markets
- Climate change demands planning over profit
- AI and automation make abundance possible

What might it look like?
- Production for use, not exchange
- Automation serving all, not profit for few
- Commons-based peer production
- Universal basic services
- Ecological planning
- Time to be human

The question isn't if, but how and when.
