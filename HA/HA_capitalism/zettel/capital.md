# Capital

## Core Insight
Money in motion, value that expands itself - not a thing but a process of continuous self-valorization through the exploitation of labor.

Capital is not just "a lot of money" or "means of production." It's value engaged in a very specific dance: M-C-M' (Money buys Commodities to make More Money).

The horror and beauty of capital: it's both dead labor (past work crystallized) and vampire (sucking living labor). It appears to grow by itself, like a strange mathematical function, but always through human sweat.

Capital has its own logic, its own needs. It uses capitalists as much as workers. We all serve its prime directive: GROW.
