# Neoliberalism

## Core Insight
The radical project to remake all of society as a market and every human as an entrepreneur of themselves - capitalism's attempt to colonize the soul.

Neoliberalism is not just "free market economics." It's a totalizing worldview that:
- Makes market logic the only logic
- Turns citizens into consumers
- Transforms rights into services
- Privatizes everything possible
- Makes inequality a virtue
- Demands we see ourselves as "human capital"

The neoliberal subject doesn't have a boss - they are their own boss, exploiting themselves 24/7. Depression isn't alienation, it's personal failure. Poverty isn't systemic, it's poor choices.

The cruelest innovation: making us internalize capitalism so deeply we police ourselves.
