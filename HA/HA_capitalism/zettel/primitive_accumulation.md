# Primitive Accumulation

## Core Insight
The violent process that created capitalism by separating producers from means of production - not the peaceful evolution of thrifty merchants but theft, murder, and enslavement on a global scale.

The fairy tale: "Once upon a time, the diligent saved while the lazy squandered, creating capitalists and workers."

The reality: Enclosure of commons. Colonial plunder. Slave trade. Witch hunts. Indigenous genocide. The "primitive" accumulation of capital required the accumulation of bones.

This isn't ancient history. Primitive accumulation continues wherever people are separated from their means of subsistence:
- Land grabs in Africa
- Privatization of water
- Enclosure of digital commons
- Student debt creating wage slaves

Capitalism was born in blood and renews itself through violence.
