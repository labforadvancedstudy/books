# Commodity

## Core Insight
An object produced not for use but for exchange - the cellular form of capitalism where use-value is held hostage by exchange-value.

A chair made to sit in is just a chair. A chair made to sell is a commodity. Same atoms, completely different social reality.

The commodity form spreads like a virus:
- Labor becomes a commodity (labor-power)
- Land becomes a commodity (real estate)
- Ideas become commodities (intellectual property)
- Relationships become commodities (social media engagement)
- Even critique becomes commodity (Che Guevara t-shirts)

Everything solid melts into price tags.
