# Capitalism as System

## Core Insight
Not just an economy but a total social form that shapes every aspect of human life - from how we work to how we love to how we die.

Capitalism is not markets (those are ancient). Not money (older still). Not even industry (that's just machinery). Capitalism is the specific system where:
- Production is for profit, not use
- Labor power is a commodity
- Means of production are privately owned
- Accumulation is the prime directive
- Everything tends toward commodification

It's a system with its own logic, its own metabolism, its own needs. It shapes us more than we shape it. We are its products as much as its producers.

The system totalizes: no outside, no exit, no alternative. Until there is.
