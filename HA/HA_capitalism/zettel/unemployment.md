# Unemployment

## Core Insight
The disciplinary mechanism that ensures workers accept low wages and poor conditions - capitalism's reserve army of the desperate.

Unemployment is not a bug but a feature. A full-employment capitalism would see wages rise until profits vanished. So the system maintains a pool of the unemployed, hungry enough to take any job, grateful for any wage.

The threat whispers in every workplace: "Don't complain, or you'll join them."

The cruelty is exquisite: we have the technology to eliminate scarcity, but maintain artificial scarcity of jobs to maintain the scarcity of bargaining power.
