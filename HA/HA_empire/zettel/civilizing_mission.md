# Civilizing Mission

## Core Insight
Oppression disguised as charity - empire's moral costume.

"We're here to help." Every empire tells this lie. Rome brought law to barbarians. Spain brought Christ to heathens. Britain brought progress to primitives. France had a "mission civilisatrice." America brings democracy. The conquered should be grateful.

The civilizing mission performs crucial psychological work. It transforms conquerors from thieves into teachers, exploitation into education. Colonial administrators could sleep peacefully knowing they were lifting up the benighted. Even better, it recruits the colonized as junior partners in their own subjugation.

But the deepest cut: sometimes they do bring roads, schools, hospitals. Real benefits entangled with systematic theft. This partial truth makes the lie harder to reject. The colonized face an impossible choice - accept the whole package or be labeled ungrateful savages. The mission "civilizes" everyone into accepting empire as natural.
