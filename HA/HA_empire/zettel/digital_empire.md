# Digital Empire

## Core Insight
When territory becomes topology and subjects become users - empire in the cloud.

Digital empires rule without land. Google's realm spans every border. Facebook's subjects outnumber any historical empire. Amazon's infrastructure rivals Rome's roads. These aren't metaphors - they're functional empires extracting data instead of gold, attention instead of tribute.

The architecture inverts: instead of center-periphery, it's platform-user. Instead of territorial control, it's protocol control. Instead of cultural hegemony, it's algorithmic hegemony. Your thoughts shape themselves to what the search bar accepts. Your relationships conform to what the platform permits. Softer than soft power - it feels like freedom.

But digital empires face digital rebellions. Code can be copied, networks can fork, attention can shift. The Arab Spring used Facebook against governments. Cryptocurrencies route around financial controls. Yet each rebellion seems to birth new empires. The medium itself is imperial. We escape one platform only to land on another.
