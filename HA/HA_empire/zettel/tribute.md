# Tribute

## Core Insight
Wealth flows upward - the economic heartbeat of empire.

Tribute is conquest made routine. After the swords are sheathed, the tax collectors arrive. Gold, grain, slaves, soldiers - all flow from periphery to center. The conquered pay for their own subjugation.

Ancient empires were tribute machines. The Aztecs demanded cacao and feathers. Rome wanted grain from Egypt, silver from Spain. The British extracted cotton from India, tea from China. The form changes, but the direction never does: from the many to the few, from the weak to the strong.

Tribute isn't just economic - it's psychological. Every payment reminds the subjected who rules whom. Every caravan heading to the capital reinforces the hierarchy. The empire feeds on tribute like a heart pumps blood.
