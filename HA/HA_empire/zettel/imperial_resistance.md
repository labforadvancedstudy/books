# Imperial Resistance

## Core Insight
Every empire generates its own antibodies - resistance is as structural as domination.

Resistance isn't external to empire; it's produced by it. The same forces that create submission create rebellion. Centralization breeds particularism. Cultural hegemony preserves what it tries to erase. Economic extraction creates classes with nothing to lose. Empire manufactures its own enemies.

The forms evolve with empire itself. Against Rome's legions, guerrilla warfare. Against British culture, nationalist revival. Against American capitalism, anti-globalization. The resistance always learns empire's language - using Roman law against Rome, British education against Britain. The master's tools sometimes do dismantle the master's house.

But the deepest resistance is invisible: foot-dragging, feigned incompetence, willful misunderstanding. James Scott called it "weapons of the weak." Every empire thinks it rules minds, but finds thoughts ungovernable. Behind every submissive face, small rebellions. Death by a thousand cuts, each too small to punish.
