# Imperial Overreach

## Core Insight
Empire's appetite exceeds its digestion - the beginning of every end.

Empires die of success. Each conquest demands garrison troops. Each province needs administrators. Each border requires fortification. The machine that creates growth eventually consumes more than it produces. Rome couldn't defend Britain and Dacia. Spain couldn't hold Netherlands and Americas. The eagle spreads its wings until they tear.

The mathematics are merciless. Territorial expansion follows surface area, but defensive needs follow perimeter length. A doubled empire needs more than double the troops. Meanwhile, the center grows decadent on tribute while peripheries grow restive under exploitation. The equation becomes unsolvable.

But empires can't stop expanding. Legitimacy depends on victory, economics on new tribute sources, military elites on fresh conquests. Like sharks, they die if they stop moving. Every empire contains its own defeat - the successful conqueror becomes the overextended defender. Icarus with borders.
