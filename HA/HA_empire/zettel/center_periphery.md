# Center-Periphery

## Core Insight
The fundamental geometry of empire - everything flows toward the center.

Empire creates spatial inequality. Rome, London, Beijing - these centers glow with accumulated wealth and power while peripheries are drained to feed them. It's not just geography; it's a relationship. The center defines itself by what it extracts from edges.

This structure replicates fractally. The colonial capital dominates the colony, provincial cities dominate countryside, district seats dominate villages. Each level siphons resources upward. A pyramid of pyramids, all pointing toward the imperial metropole.

The periphery isn't just poor - it's structured to be poor. Its railways lead to ports, not to each other. Its economy produces what the center needs, not what locals want. Even rebellion often dreams only of becoming a new center, perpetuating the pattern. The geometry of empire imprints itself on conquered minds.
