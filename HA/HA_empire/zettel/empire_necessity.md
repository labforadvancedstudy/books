# Empire Necessity

## Core Insight
Empire emerges from human organization like crystals from solution - inevitable under certain conditions.

Is empire a choice or a physical law? When population density crosses thresholds, when agricultural surplus enables specialization, when military technology creates force asymmetries - empire crystallizes. Not because anyone plans it, but because the system space allows no other stable configuration.

Consider the counterfactual: could Mediterranean civilization have developed without Rome? Could East Asia have modernized without Chinese imperial cycles? The specific empires were contingent, but empire itself seems thermodynamically favored. Like water finding the lowest level, power finds its maximum concentration.

This necessity explains empire's universality. Every continent, every era - the pattern repeats. Not cultural copying but convergent evolution. The question isn't why empires form but why anything else occasionally does. Democracy, federation, anarchy - these are unstable exceptions to empire's stable rule. Gravity for human organization.
