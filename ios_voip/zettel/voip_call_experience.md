# VoIP Call Experience

## Core Insight
VoIP call experience is visceral and immediate - users feel the technology through delays, echoes, and dropouts before they think about it.

The physical experience starts with the ring. Is it loud enough to hear but not jarring? Does it interrupt other audio gracefully? The haptic feedback matters too - vibration patterns signal urgency. That first moment of notification sets emotional tone: intrusion or welcome connection.

The answer gesture has evolved. Swipe to answer feels deliberate. Tap feels accidental. The green/red button metaphor persists from physical phones. But the gesture must work reliably - failed swipes while fumbling for a ringing phone create frustration that colors the entire call.

Audio latency is felt, not measured. Under 150ms feels simultaneous. You interrupt each other naturally, laugh together, have normal conversation rhythm. At 300ms, you notice hesitation. You start saying "go ahead" after collisions. At 500ms, conversation becomes formal turn-taking. The emotional connection degrades with latency.

Echo destroys intimacy. Hearing yourself breaks the illusion of presence. Your attention shifts from the conversation to the technology. You become self-conscious, speaking differently. Even subtle echo makes calls feel distant and mechanical.

Background noise tells stories. You hear where someone is - the coffee shop, the car, the windy street. This context can enhance connection or distract. Good noise suppression removes distraction while preserving character. Over-aggressive suppression makes voices sound synthetic.

The end of calls needs closure. Abrupt disconnection feels wrong. The brief "call ended" tone provides psychological completion. Some apps play subtle sound effects - not skeuomorphic but emotionally satisfying. The UI transition back to the app should feel smooth, not jarring.
