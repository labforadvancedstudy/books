## Things Keep Going

Your grandmother had your mother's eyes. Your mother has yours. Someday, if you have children, they might have them too. 

This is the simplest truth we know: life continues. Not the same life - your grandmother is gone, and someday you will be too. But something persists. Something passes through.

Look at any family photo album. See the nose that appears in 1920, disappears in 1950, then shows up again in 1980. Watch how a gesture - the way great-aunt Sarah tilted her head when thinking - suddenly appears in a child who never met her.

But it's bigger than families. Much bigger.

Every spring, the same flowers bloom in the same places. Not the exact same flowers - last year's are dead. But something remembered. Something instructed new flowers to grow right there, with those exact petals, that precise shade of yellow.

Birds return to the same nesting grounds their parents used. Salmon swim upstream to spawn where they were born. Monarch butterflies - weighing less than a paperclip - navigate thousands of miles to trees they've never seen, following a map written by ancestors they never met.

## The Pattern

Stand in a forest. It looks permanent, ancient, unchanging. But every tree is temporary. The oak that shades you might live 300 years - impressive to us, but still mortal. Yet the forest persists for thousands of years. How?

Because forests aren't really made of trees. They're made of *patterns* of trees. Instructions for making trees. Programs that run themselves, over and over, each execution slightly different but fundamentally the same.

Your body replaces most of its cells every 7-10 years. The you of today shares few atoms with the you of a decade ago. Yet you persist. Your memories, your scars, the way you laugh - all maintained by something deeper than mere matter.

We are all temporary. Life is not.

Life is the pattern that persists when everything else passes away. It's the message that keeps copying itself, the song that keeps singing, the story that keeps telling itself with endless variations on ancient themes.

## The Mystery Deepens

Here's what's strange: life doesn't just persist. It insists. 

Leave a parking lot alone for a few years. Cracks appear. In those cracks, impossibly, green things grow. No one planted them. No one watered them. But there they are, breaking through concrete, reclaiming space, insisting on living.

Seal a jar of sterile water. Wait. Eventually, if there's even the tiniest flaw in your sterilization, life appears. It finds a way. It always finds a way.

We've found bacteria in nuclear reactor cores, in boiling acid pools, in ice that's been frozen for millions of years. We've found life in clouds, in solid rock miles underground, in the dead sea that kills everything else.

Life doesn't just persist. It pushes. It explores. It tries everything, goes everywhere, tests every boundary. It's not content to merely continue - it must expand, experiment, elaborate.

## Why Should Anything Continue?

The real mystery isn't how life persists - we'll explore that in the levels above. The real mystery is why there's persistence at all.

Why should patterns copy themselves? Why should information insist on its own continuation? In a universe trending toward disorder, why does life trend toward greater order, greater complexity, greater insistence on being?

We don't know. 

Maybe we can't know.

But we can observe: In this universe, some patterns persist. And the patterns that persist better... persist better. It's circular, almost tautological. Yet from this simple loop, everything else follows.

Welcome to evolution - the study of how persistence persists.
