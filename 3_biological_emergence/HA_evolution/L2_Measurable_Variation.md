# L2: Measurable Variation
## Counting What Changes

In L1, we saw that things change. Now let's measure how much.

Take a handful of beans from a jar. Lay them out. Even if they're all "black beans," look closer. This one's slightly longer. That one's rounder. This one has a tiny dent. That one's almost purple in the right light.

Now weigh them. Plot the weights on a graph. You'll get a bell curve - most beans cluster around average, with fewer at the extremes. This curve shape appears everywhere in nature. Height, weight, running speed, number of offspring, resistance to disease. 

Variation isn't chaos. It has patterns we can measure.

## The Discovery of Normal

In 1835, Adolphe Quetelet was studying human measurements. Height, weight, chest circumference - thousands of data points from soldiers. He expected chaos. He found order.

The measurements formed bell curves. Not just rough approximations - precise mathematical curves. The same curves that described errors in astronomy described human variation. As if nature was aiming for an average and missing by predictable amounts.

This was revolutionary. Variation wasn't failure or imperfection. It was normal. Expected. Quantifiable.

We could finally ask: How much variation is there? Is there more variation in height or weight? Are men more variable than women? Are humans more variable than chimps?

## Darwin's Pigeon Problem

Darwin spent years measuring pigeons. Not because he loved pigeons (though he grew fond of them), but because pigeon fanciers had created extreme variation through breeding.

The pouter's inflatable crop. The fantail's ridiculous tail. The tumbler's aerial acrobatics. The jacobin's neck feathers like an Elizabethan collar. All from the same ancestor - the common rock dove.

He measured everything. Beak length: 0.7 to 1.4 inches. Tail feathers: 12 to 42. Wingspan variation of 40%. If you found these birds in nature, you'd classify them as different species. Maybe different genera.

But Darwin could trace the breeding. He knew they were one species, pushed to extremes by human selection. If humans could create this much variation in centuries, what could nature do with millions of years?

## Mendel Counts Peas

While Darwin measured pigeons, Gregor Mendel counted peas. Seven years. Thousands of plants. 28,000 pea plants examined. He was looking for ratios.

Round vs wrinkled seeds: 5,474 round, 1,850 wrinkled. Ratio: 2.96 to 1.
Yellow vs green seeds: 6,022 yellow, 2,001 green. Ratio: 3.01 to 1.
Tall vs short plants: 787 tall, 277 short. Ratio: 2.84 to 1.

Always close to 3:1. Not exactly 3:1 - nature is messy. But close enough to suggest a law. Variation wasn't random. It followed rules. Mathematical rules.

Mendel had discovered genes without knowing it. He'd found the atoms of inheritance.

## Industrial Melanism By The Numbers

Remember the peppered moths from L1? Scientists didn't just notice the change - they measured it.

Manchester, 1848: 0% melanic (black) forms
Manchester, 1895: 98% melanic forms
Manchester, 1962: 94% melanic forms
Manchester, 1998: 19% melanic forms

Plot it on a graph. The line rises sharply from 1850-1900 as pollution increases. It plateaus during peak industrial times. Then falls after clean air laws.

You can calculate selection coefficients. The melanic form had about a 50% survival advantage during peak pollution. That's huge. Most evolutionary advantages are 1-5%. This was evolution on fast-forward.

## Measuring Fitness

"Survival of the fittest" is useless if you can't measure fitness. Evolution solved this: fitness equals reproductive success. Count the babies.

A bacterium that divides every 20 minutes has higher fitness than one that divides every 30 minutes. After 24 hours: 4.7 × 10²¹ vs 1.2 × 10¹⁴ cells. The faster reproducer wins by a million million fold.

But it's not always about speed. Sometimes it's about efficiency. In nutrient-poor environments, the bacterium that survives on less might divide slower but live longer. Count the grandchildren, great-grandchildren. Long-term fitness matters.

## The Variation Pump

Where does variation come from? We can measure that too.

Mutation rates:
- Bacteria: ~0.003 mutations per genome per generation
- Humans: ~100 mutations per genome per generation
- RNA viruses: ~1 mutation per genome per generation

Most mutations do nothing. Some harm. A precious few help. But with billions of individuals and thousands of generations, even rare beneficial mutations appear regularly.

Sexual reproduction amplifies variation. Take human height - controlled by ~700 genetic variants. Each parent has different variants. Mix and match during reproduction. The number of possible combinations exceeds the number of humans who have ever lived.

We're all genetic experiments, each slightly different from all who came before.

## Geographic Patterns

Measure skull shape across human populations. Plot on a map. You'll see gradients - gradual changes across geography. Nose shape correlates with climate. Skin color with UV exposure. Body proportions with temperature.

These aren't discrete categories. They're continuous variables. Measure enough people, plot carefully enough, and you see evolution's ongoing experiments with human form.

The same patterns appear in every species. Song sparrows are larger in Alaska than Mexico. Bergmann's rule: body size increases with latitude. It's about surface area to volume ratios and heat retention. Physics shapes biology.

## Molecular Measures

Now we can measure variation directly in DNA. The human genome: 3 billion base pairs. Between any two humans: ~3 million differences. That's 99.9% identical, 0.1% different.

Sounds tiny. But 0.1% of 3 billion is 3 million. That's 3 million experiments in being human. Some affect nothing. Some change everything.

Compare humans to chimps: 98.8% identical DNA. Just 1.2% difference. About 35 million base pair differences. Somehow, in that 1.2% lies the difference between writing poetry and eating termites with a stick.

## The Limits of Measurement

We can measure variation in:
- Morphology (shape and structure)
- Physiology (function and performance)
- Behavior (what organisms do)
- Molecules (DNA, proteins)
- Fitness (reproductive success)

But measurement has limits. How do you measure a peacock's beauty? A song's attractiveness? The subtle ways animals assess each other?

We try. Scientists play recorded songs to females, measure response. Show videos of males, track female attention. It's crude but revealing. Beauty isn't arbitrary. It correlates with health, genes, resources.

## What The Numbers Tell Us

Measuring variation revealed evolution's raw material. Life doesn't just have variation - it has *heritable* variation. Children resemble parents but aren't identical. The differences matter. Selection can act on them.

Without variation, evolution stops. Clone populations can't evolve (except through new mutations). Sexual reproduction exists partly to maintain variation - to keep shuffling the genetic deck.

Too much variation and populations fall apart. Too little and they can't adapt. Life walks a tightrope between chaos and stagnation.

## The Deep Pattern

Measure enough organisms and a pattern emerges:
1. Continuous variation in most traits
2. Bell curve distributions
3. Heritable differences
4. Geographic gradients
5. Correlation with environment

This pattern repeats at every scale. Bacteria to blue whales. Molecules to morphology. As if life everywhere is running the same experiment: generate variation, test against environment, repeat.

We've learned to read evolution's handwriting in the numbers.
