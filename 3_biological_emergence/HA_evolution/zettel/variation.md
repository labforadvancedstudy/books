# Variation

## Core Insight
No two organisms are exactly alike - differences are the raw material of evolution.

Variation is the foundation of evolution. Look at any population - humans, dogs, bacteria - and you'll see differences. Some are tall, some short. Some fast, some slow. Some resistant to disease, others vulnerable.

These differences matter because they affect survival and reproduction. In a drought, plants with deeper roots survive. In a cold snap, animals with thicker fur thrive. Without variation, evolution has nothing to work with.

Variation comes from many sources: mutations change DNA, sexual reproduction shuffles genes, environmental factors affect development. Even identical twins aren't perfectly identical.

The key insight: variation isn't noise or error - it's potential. Each difference is an experiment nature is running. Most fail, some succeed spectacularly.
