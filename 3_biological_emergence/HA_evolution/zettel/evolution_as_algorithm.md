# Evolution as Algorithm

## Core Insight
Evolution is a substrate-neutral search algorithm - variation, selection, and heredity create a universal problem-solver.

Strip away DNA, organisms, and biology. What remains? An algorithm: Generate variants. Test against criteria. Amplify successes. Repeat. This process works on anything that can vary, be selected, and reproduce patterns.

Computer scientists rediscovered this. Genetic algorithms solve engineering problems. Evolutionary programming designs circuits. Artificial life evolves in silicon. The algorithm doesn't care about its substrate - only that the three conditions are met.

The power lies in parallel search. Evolution tests millions of solutions simultaneously. No designer needed, no foresight required. Just massive parallel trial-and-error with memory (inheritance) to preserve gains.

This abstraction reveals evolution's universality. It operates on genes, memes, technologies, universes. Anywhere information can replicate with variation and selection, evolution emerges. It's not just biology - it's a fundamental feature of reality.
