# Evolution Zettel Index

This directory contains atomic concepts related to evolution, organized by abstraction level.

## L1-L2: Observable Foundations
- [[variation]] - The raw material of evolution
- [[inheritance]] - Traits passed to offspring  
- [[change_over_time]] - Organisms change

## L3: Core Mechanisms
- [[natural_selection]] - Differential survival and reproduction
- [[mutation]] - Source of new variation
- [[adaptation]] - Fit between organism and environment
- [[fitness]] - Reproductive success

## L4: Population Level
- [[gene_flow]] - Migration of alleles between populations
- [[genetic_drift]] - Random changes in allele frequencies
- [[population_genetics]] - Mathematical framework of evolution
- [[hardy_weinberg]] - Null hypothesis of evolution

## L5: Macro Patterns
- [[speciation]] - Origin of new species
- [[phylogenetics]] - Evolutionary relationships
- [[convergent_evolution]] - Independent evolution of similar traits
- [[divergent_evolution]] - Related species becoming different

## L6: Abstract Principles
- [[evolution_as_algorithm]] - Substrate-neutral search process
- [[complexity_increase]] - Information accumulation over time
- [[hierarchical_selection]] - Evolution at multiple levels

## L7: Universal Applications
- [[universal_darwinism]] - Evolution beyond biology
- [[cultural_evolution]] - Evolution of ideas and behaviors
- [[digital_evolution]] - Evolution in computational systems

## L8: Deep Connections
- [[evolution_as_computation]] - Information processing view
- [[entropy_and_evolution]] - Thermodynamic perspective
- [[quantum_evolution]] - Quantum effects in evolution

## L9: Ultimate Questions
- [[consciousness_evolution]] - How awareness emerged
- [[evolution_purpose]] - Teleology and direction
- [[cosmic_evolution]] - Evolution at universal scales

Each zettel is a self-contained insight that connects to others through the [[double bracket]] links. Together they form a network of understanding about evolution at all scales.
