# Adaptation

## Core Insight
Organisms fit their environments like keys fit locks - shaped by selection's patient hand.

Look at a cactus in the desert: thick skin to prevent water loss, spines instead of leaves, shallow roots to catch rare rain. Every feature screams "desert!" This isn't planning - it's adaptation.

Adaptations are evolution's solutions to environmental problems. Giraffes' long necks reach high leaves. Bats' echolocation navigates darkness. Antifreeze proteins keep Antarctic fish from freezing. Each is a hard-won victory over selection's filter.

The fit can be breathtakingly precise. Orchids shaped exactly like the wasps that pollinate them. Moths colored to match specific tree bark. Bacteria with enzymes tailored to their food source.

But adaptations are historical compromises, not perfect designs. Your back hurts because spines evolved for horizontal posture, then got repurposed for walking upright. Evolution can only modify what exists, not start fresh.
