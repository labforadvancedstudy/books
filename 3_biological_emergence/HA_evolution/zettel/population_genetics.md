# Population Genetics

## Core Insight
Evolution is a change in allele frequencies - populations evolve, not individuals.

Individuals are born, live, and die with the same genes. But zoom out to populations, and you see gene frequencies shifting like tides. More brown beetles this generation, fewer green ones. That's evolution happening.

Population genetics is evolution's mathematics. It tracks alleles (gene variants) like accountants track money. Selection increases beneficial alleles, drift randomly changes frequencies, mutation adds new alleles, gene flow moves them around.

The power is in prediction. Given starting frequencies and forces acting, we can calculate future evolution. Will a beneficial mutation spread? How fast? Will populations diverge? The math tells us.

This transformed evolution from storytelling to science. We can measure selection strength, test hypotheses, predict outcomes. It revealed surprising truths: most DNA changes are neutral, populations need size to evolve efficiently, sex accelerates adaptation.
