# Change Over Time

## Core Insight
Life isn't static - populations transform across generations, accumulating differences.

Look at old photos of dog breeds from 100 years ago. They're barely recognizable. Bulldogs had longer snouts, German Shepherds stood differently. In just a century, visible change.

Now imagine millions of years. Fossils tell the story: fish developing limbs, reptiles growing feathers, apes walking upright. Not overnight transformations - gradual shifts, generation by generation.

The key is that small changes add up. A slightly longer beak helps reach food. Offspring inherit it. Over time, beaks get longer still. What seems impossible in one lifetime becomes inevitable over many.

We can watch it happen: bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance in months, Darwin's finches changing beak sizes in decades. Evolution isn't just history - it's happening now, all around us.
