# Quantum Evolution

## Core Insight
Quantum effects may influence mutation and selection - evolution might harness quantum mechanics for advantage.

Classical evolution assumes mutations are random. But what if life exploits quantum mechanics? Some evidence suggests it might. Photosynthesis uses quantum coherence. Bird navigation may use quantum entanglement. Evolution discovers what works.

Quantum mutation is controversial but intriguing. DNA bases can exist in superposition before measurement (replication) collapses them. This could create directed variation - mutations more likely to be beneficial. Evolution evolving evolvability.

In many-worlds interpretation, every quantum event branches reality. Evolution occurs across all branches simultaneously. What we see is the anthropic slice - branches where observers evolved. Quantum suicide at cosmic scale.

The implications stagger. If evolution uses quantum effects, it's not blind. If many-worlds is true, all possible evolutionary paths exist. Biology and physics merge at reality's foundations. Evolution might be deeper than we imagined.
