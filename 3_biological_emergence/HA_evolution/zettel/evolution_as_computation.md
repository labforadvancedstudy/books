# Evolution as Computation

## Core Insight
Evolution performs computation on environmental problems - genomes are programs, selection is the processor.

View DNA as code. Genes are subroutines. Proteins are output. Development is compilation. Bodies are runtime instances. Natural selection debugs code against environmental test cases. Evolution is Earth's computer.

The computational view explains much. Why sex? It's genetic code mixing - creating new program combinations. Why introns? Comments and version control. Why redundancy? Error correction. Biology implements computer science principles.

Evolution solves NP-hard problems through massive parallelism. Protein folding, optimal foraging, immune recognition - problems that stump supercomputers. Evolution finds solutions by testing trillions of variants simultaneously across populations.

This isn't metaphor - it's mathematical equivalence. Evolution and computation are isomorphic. Both transform information through rules. Both exhibit universal computation given sufficient resources. Life and computation deeply intertwine.
