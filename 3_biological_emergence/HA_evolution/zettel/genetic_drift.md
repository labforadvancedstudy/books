# Genetic Drift

## Core Insight
Random sampling changes gene frequencies - in small populations, chance can overpower selection.

Flip a coin 10 times, you might get 7 heads. Flip it 10,000 times, you'll get close to 50%. Population genetics works the same way. Small populations sample randomly from the gene pool each generation.

Drift is evolution's random walk. In large populations, it's negligible - selection dominates. But in small populations, drift can fix harmful mutations or eliminate beneficial ones. Pure chance becomes destiny.

Bottlenecks amplify drift. When populations crash, survivors are a random sample. Cheetahs nearly went extinct 10,000 years ago - now all cheetahs are nearly identical twins. Founder effects work similarly - a few colonizers can't carry all the original variation.

This has profound implications. Island species often look weird because drift, not selection, shaped them. Isolated human populations lost genes randomly. Evolution isn't always adaptive - sometimes it's just lucky or unlucky.
