# Mutation

## Core Insight
Random copying errors in DNA create new possibilities - evolution's creative force.

Every time a cell divides, it copies 3 billion letters of DNA. Amazingly accurate, but not perfect. About 100 errors per human generation. Most do nothing. Some break things. Rarely, one improves something.

Mutations are evolution's dice roll. A single letter change can alter a protein's shape, create a new function, or activate a dormant gene. The mutation giving some humans lactose tolerance? One letter. The mutation protecting against malaria? One letter.

Without mutation, evolution would grind to a halt. All variation would eventually be used up. But mutations constantly inject new possibilities. Most fail immediately. Natural selection sorts the winners from losers.

The rate matters. Too many mutations and organisms fall apart. Too few and evolution stalls. Life has evolved error-checking mechanisms that hit a sweet spot - enough mutation for innovation, not so much for chaos.
