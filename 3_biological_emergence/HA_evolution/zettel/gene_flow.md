# Gene Flow

## Core Insight
Migration moves genes between populations, homogenizing differences and spreading innovations.

Imagine populations as pools of genes. Left alone, each pool evolves differently. But organisms move. A bird flies to a new island, a seed drifts on the wind, a fish swims upstream. They carry their genes with them.

Gene flow is evolution's mixing force. It counteracts the differentiating effects of selection and drift. One migrant per generation can be enough to keep populations genetically similar. Too much flow, and local adaptations can't evolve.

It spreads beneficial mutations faster than they could arise independently. Pesticide resistance in insects, drug resistance in bacteria - often spread by gene flow, not evolved repeatedly.

Human history is written in gene flow patterns. Agriculture spread with farmers' genes. Trade routes show up in DNA. Even Neanderthal genes flowed into our ancestors. Every migration leaves genetic echoes.
