# Fitness

## Core Insight
Evolutionary success is measured in offspring, not strength - reproduction is the only currency that matters.

Fitness confuses people. A bodybuilder who dies childless has zero evolutionary fitness. A frail person with ten thriving grandchildren is evolution's champion. It's not about being "fit" - it's about genetic legacy.

More precisely: fitness is your genetic contribution to future generations relative to others. It's always comparative, always contextual. The fastest cheetah in a drought might starve while the efficient one survives.

Fitness has components: survival to reproductive age, finding mates, producing offspring, offspring survival. Fail any step, fitness drops to zero. This creates trade-offs. Energy spent on peacock feathers can't go to immune systems.

Crucially, fitness is environment-specific. White fur is high fitness in the Arctic, suicide in the jungle. When environments change, fitness landscapes shift. Yesterday's winners become today's losers.
