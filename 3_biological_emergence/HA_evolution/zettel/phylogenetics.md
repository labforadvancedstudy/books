# Phylogenetics

## Core Insight
Life's family tree revealed through shared descent - tracing evolutionary relationships through time.

Every organism carries its evolutionary history in its DNA. Like a family photo album written in molecules. By comparing sequences, we can reconstruct who's related to whom and when lineages diverged.

The principle is simple: similar sequences imply recent common ancestry. Humans and chimps share 98% of DNA - we split 6 million years ago. Humans and bananas share 60% - we split 1.5 billion years ago.

Building trees requires careful analysis. Some similarities are inherited (homology), others evolved independently (homoplasy). Molecular clocks tick at different rates. But patterns emerge: nested hierarchies of life.

Phylogenetics revolutionized biology. Whales are modified hippos. Birds are living dinosaurs. Fungi are closer to animals than plants. Every tree rewrite our understanding of life's history and reveals evolution's true patterns.
