# Universal Darwinism

## Core Insight
Darwinian processes operate wherever replication, variation, and selection exist - evolution transcends biology.

Darwin discovered something bigger than biology. His mechanism - differential replication of variants - applies to any system with the right properties. Genes evolve. So do ideas, technologies, companies, even universes.

Consider memes: ideas that replicate through minds. They vary through misunderstanding and creativity. They face selection through attention and memory limits. Successful memes spread; others die. Pure Darwinism, no DNA required.

Or technology: designs replicate through manufacturing. Engineers create variations. Markets select winners. The smartphone in your pocket evolved from rotary phones through market selection, not biological evolution.

The universality is breathtaking. Quantum states in many-worlds evolve Darwinistically. Universes with different constants might undergo cosmological natural selection. Anywhere patterns replicate with variation, Darwin's ghost appears.
