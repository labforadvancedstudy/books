# Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

## Core Insight
Without evolutionary forces, allele frequencies stay constant - the null hypothesis of evolution.

In 1908, Hardy and Weinberg independently realized something profound: Mendelian inheritance alone doesn't change gene frequencies. Mix AA, Aa, and aa individuals randomly, and next generation has the same proportions.

The math is elegant: if p is frequency of A and q is frequency of a, then genotype frequencies are p² (AA), 2pq (Aa), and q² (aa). Forever. Unless something disrupts equilibrium.

That's the key - it defines "no evolution." Like Newton's first law for genetics. Populations stay in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium unless acted on by forces: selection, drift, mutation, migration, non-random mating.

Deviations reveal evolution in action. Too few heterozygotes? Maybe inbreeding. Changing frequencies? Selection or drift at work. It's evolution's baseline, letting us detect and measure evolutionary forces.
