# L1: Observable Change
## Things Are Different Now

Look at your dog. Now look at a wolf. 

Something happened there. They're clearly related - the eyes, the teeth, the way they cock their heads when curious. But your golden retriever would last about five minutes in the wild, while the wolf would make a terrible house pet.

They weren't always different. We know this because we did it. We changed them.

## The Speed of Visible Change

You don't need millions of years to see evolution. You don't even need a lifetime. Sometimes you just need to pay attention.

In 1971, scientists brought five pairs of Italian wall lizards to a Croatian island. The island already had lizards, but not these particular ones. Then war broke out, and the scientists couldn't return.

Thirty-six years later, they came back. The Italian lizards had taken over. But they weren't the same lizards anymore. Their heads were bigger. Their bite force had increased by 17%. They'd evolved cecal valves - a gut structure their ancestors never had - to digest the island's plants.

Thirty-six years. That's nothing in evolutionary time. That's barely one human generation. Yet it was enough to visibly change an entire species.

## The Peppered Moths Tell Time

Before the Industrial Revolution, peppered moths in England were mostly white with black speckles. Like salt and pepper on rice, they disappeared against lichen-covered tree bark. The rare black moths stood out like soot stains. Birds ate them first.

Then factories filled the air with coal smoke. Trees turned black. Suddenly, the white moths stood out like snowflakes on charcoal. The black moths vanished against the bark.

By 1895, 98% of peppered moths in Manchester were black. Evolution had flipped the population in fifty years. Not because moths "decided" to turn black. Not because soot stained them. But because birds ate the visible ones, and the invisible ones had babies.

Then came the Clean Air Act of 1956. Factories installed scrubbers. Trees gradually lightened. By 1998, the black moths were rare again. Evolution ran the movie in reverse.

You can see evolution happen. You just need to know where to look.

## Your Own Evolution

You carry evolution's evidence in your body. That appendix that nearly killed your uncle? It's the shriveled remains of a cecum that helped your ancestors digest cellulose. You don't need it anymore, but evolution is a tinkerer, not an engineer. It doesn't remove old parts cleanly.

Wisdom teeth that don't fit in your jaw? Your ancestors had bigger jaws for tougher food. Jaws shrank faster than tooth number. Evolution is still catching up.

Goosebumps when you're cold or scared? Your furry ancestors fluffed their hair for warmth or to look bigger to predators. The fur is gone, but the reflex remains. A ghost of ancient fears, written in your skin.

## Darwin's Islands

The Galápagos finches told Darwin their story through their beaks. Each island had different food. Each finch population had different beaks. Not random differences - specific matches. 

Big, crushing beaks where the seeds were hard. Long, probing beaks where food hid in cracks. Sharp, pointed beaks where insects were the meal. Each beak a tool, shaped by survival.

But here's what Darwin noticed: they were all still finches. Changed, specialized, adapted - but clearly related. Like your dog and the wolf. Like you and your cousin. Different, but family.

The differences weren't random. They matched the islands. As if each population had been molded by its home, shaped by what worked there.

## Bacteria Don't Lie

Want to see evolution really fly? Watch bacteria. They reproduce every twenty minutes. That's 72 generations per day. A thousand generations per fortnight.

Put bacteria in a dish with antibiotics. Most die. But if even one has a lucky mutation that helps it survive, that one becomes millions by tomorrow. By next week, the whole population laughs at your antibiotic.

Hospitals fight evolution every day. They rotate antibiotics, increase doses, combine drugs - all to stay ahead of bacterial evolution. Sometimes they lose. MRSA, resistant tuberculosis, super-gonorrhea - these aren't science fiction. They're evolution in real-time, happening in hospitals right now.

## The Farmers' Familiar Magic

Every crop we eat is evolution guided by human hands. Corn's ancestor, teosinte, looks like grass with sad, tiny seeds. Thousands of years of farmers keeping the best seeds turned it into the golden abundance we know.

Wild bananas are full of seeds hard enough to crack teeth. Edible bananas are mutant freaks, seedless and sweet, maintained only by human cultivation. We've bred them so far from their origins they can't even reproduce naturally anymore.

Broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage - they're all the same species. One plant, pushed in different directions by selection. Want leaves? Here's kale. Want flowers? Here's broccoli. Want tiny heads? Brussels sprouts. Same genetics, different destinations.

## What We Can See

Evolution at L1 is just observation:
- Things change
- Children resemble but differ from parents  
- Populations shift over time
- Changes match circumstances
- It happens fast enough to watch

We haven't explained why yet. We're just opening our eyes and noting: the world is not static. Life flows. Forms shift. What worked yesterday might fail today. What fails today might work tomorrow.

## The Speed Surprise

Darwin thought evolution was glacially slow. He was wrong. It can be slow - turning fish into humans took hundreds of millions of years. But it can also be fast - turning wolves into chihuahuas took thousands. Turning light moths dark took decades. Turning bacteria resistant takes days.

Speed depends on:
- Generation time (bacteria are fast, elephants are slow)
- Selection pressure (strong pressure, fast change)
- Population size (more individuals, more variations to test)
- Available variation (you can only select what exists)

But the key insight at L1: We can see it. Right now. In our lifetime. In our backyard. Evolution isn't ancient history. It's current events.
