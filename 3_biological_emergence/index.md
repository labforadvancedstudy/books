## Emergence Timeline
- **3.8 Gya**: RNA - first replicators
- **3.5 Gya**: DNA and first cells
- **2.5 Gya**: Photosynthesis begins
- **2.4 Gya**: Oxygen atmosphere
- **2 Gya**: Eukaryotic cells (with mitochondria)
- **1.5 Gya**: Sexual reproduction
- **1 Gya**: Multicellular life
- **550 Mya**: Nervous systems emerge
- **500 Mya**: Brains develop
- **200 Mya**: Consciousness emerges
- **50 Mya**: Self-awareness

## Key Transitions
- Chemistry → Life: Self-replication
- Single cells → Multicellular: Cooperation
- Nervous systems → Consciousness: Integration
- Consciousness → Self-awareness: Recursion

## Profound Questions
- What is life?
- Why does evolution work?
- How does matter become aware?
- Can consciousness understand itself?
