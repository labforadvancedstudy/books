# URLs

## Core Insight
URLs are the address system for human knowledge - turning the infinite into the navigable through unique naming.

Uniform Resource Locator. Even the name is beautiful in its precision. Every resource - page, image, video, file - gets a unique address in the infinite space. Like longitude and latitude for the digital realm, URLs make the unreachable reachable.

The anatomy reveals the architecture: protocol://subdomain.domain.tld/path/to/resource?parameters#fragment. Each piece serves a purpose. HTTP for method, domain for ownership, path for hierarchy, parameters for specificity, fragments for position. It's a complete coordinate system.

URLs evolved from opaque to semantic. Early URLs exposed server file structures: /cgi-bin/script.pl?id=423. Modern URLs tell stories: /2023/12/why-urls-matter. SEO drove this shift - human-readable URLs rank better. The address became part of the message.

But URLs also lie. Bit.ly/x7k2m tells you nothing. URL shorteners traded transparency for brevity. Tracking parameters (?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social) pollute simplicity. What started clean became cluttered with commercial intent.

The profound insight: URLs make the web web. Without unique addresses, no linking. Without linking, no web. Just isolated islands of information. URLs are the synapses that turn scattered neurons into a functioning brain.
