# Authentication

## Core Insight
Authentication is the internet's identity crisis solved daily - proving you are you in a world where anyone can pretend to be anyone.

Passwords were first. Secret words granting access, ancient as "open sesame." But passwords leak, get guessed, reused, stolen. The average person has 100 passwords. Nobody can remember unique complex strings for each. Password managers became necessary prosthetics.

Two-factor authentication added defense layers. Something you know (password) plus something you have (phone) or something you are (fingerprint). Inconvenient but necessary. Every added factor multiplies security exponentially.

OAuth changed the game. "Login with Google/Facebook/Twitter" meant delegated trust. Instead of creating accounts everywhere, use existing identity. Convenient but centralizing. Tech giants became identity providers, gatekeepers of the web.

Biometrics seemed perfect. Your face, fingerprint, voice - unfakeable, unforgettable. Until deepfakes arrived. Until hackers stole fingerprint databases. Biometrics can't be changed when compromised. Your password leaks? Change it. Your face leaks? Problem.

The future is passwordless. Passkeys, WebAuthn, FIDO2 - cryptographic authentication without secrets to steal. Your device proves your identity mathematically. But this ties identity to devices. Lose your phone, lose yourself?
