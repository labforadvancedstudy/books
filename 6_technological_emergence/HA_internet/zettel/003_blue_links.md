# Blue Links

## Core Insight
Blue link color is a cultural artifact so powerful it shapes how billions perceive possibility itself.

Why blue? The early web browsers (Mosaic, Netscape) chose blue for unvisited links, purple for visited. No grand design philosophy - just needed colors that contrasted with black text on white backgrounds. But this arbitrary choice became humanity's new universal symbol.

Blue = unexplored. Purple = been there. This color coding taps into deep psychology. Blue suggests sky, ocean, distance - things to explore. Purple suggests completion, royalty, the past. We internalized this mapping so thoroughly that non-blue links feel wrong.

The blue link transcends language. A child in Tokyo, grandmother in Cairo, programmer in SF - all understand blue underlined text means "click here for more." It's humanity's first truly global symbol system, more universal than any alphabet.

But we're moving beyond blue. Modern design often hides link appearance, using subtle cues or no cues at all. Everything becomes potentially clickable. The blue link era is ending, replaced by ambiguous interfaces where anything might be a portal. We're losing clarity in pursuit of aesthetics.

Yet when you really need someone to click, what do you do? Make it blue. Underline it. The old magic still works.
