# Browsers

## Core Insight
Browsers are humanity's sensory organs for the digital realm - evolving from simple viewers to complete operating systems.

Mosaic showed us the web. Netscape made it usable. Internet Explorer dominated through bundling. Firefox proved open source could compete. Chrome redefined speed. Each browser generation didn't just improve - it reimagined what browsing meant.

The browser wars weren't about software but worldview. Microsoft wanted the browser as Windows extension. Google wanted it as web OS. Mozilla wanted it open and free. Apple wanted it private and elegant. These philosophies shaped how billions experience the internet.

Modern browsers are technological marvels. They parse HTML, execute JavaScript, render graphics, play video, handle cryptography, manage memory, sandbox malicious code - all while feeling instant. The browser is arguably humanity's most complex widely-used software.

Tabs changed how we think. Before tabs, one page at a time. After tabs, parallel browsing. We learned to juggle contexts, research in branches, never close anything. Tab management became a personality test. 5 tabs? Focused. 50 tabs? Chaotic. 500 tabs? Digital hoarder.

The browser became invisible through ubiquity. We say "go online" but mean "open browser." It's the window through which we see the digital world. So fundamental we forget it's there, like forgetting you're wearing glasses.
