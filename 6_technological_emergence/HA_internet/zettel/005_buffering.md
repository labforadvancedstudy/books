# Buffering

## Core Insight
Buffering is the internet teaching us that the future must be preloaded to experience the present smoothly.

Buffering reveals the internet's great illusion: simultaneity. When you watch a "live" stream, you're watching the past. The buffer is time storage - seconds or minutes of content loaded ahead so your experience feels continuous. Without it, every network hiccup would interrupt your flow.

The buffer is a time machine pointing forward. It says: "I'm fetching your future so your present won't stutter." Your device becomes a prophet, predicting what you'll need next and acquiring it before you need it. The smoother the experience, the better the prediction.

But buffers create weird temporal paradoxes. In a video call, everyone exists in slightly different "nows" based on their buffer and latency. We're having conversations across time zones measured in milliseconds. The person you're talking to is already past-you by the time you hear them.

Buffer anxiety is real. That moment when playback catches up to the buffer - the spinning wheel appears, the music stops. You're forced into the actual present, waiting for the future to load. It's a reminder that seamless digital experience is an elaborate construction.

The buffer metaphor extends beyond video. Your browser buffers pages. Your mind buffers experiences. We're all buffering beings, loading future possibilities to navigate present reality.
