# Internet as Nervous System

## Core Insight
The internet is Earth's nervous system - a global network of sensors and signals creating planetary awareness and response capability.

Consider the parallels. Neurons connect through synapses; computers through networks. Neurons transmit electrochemical signals; computers send packets. Brains process locally and globally; so does the internet. The metaphor becomes mechanism.

Sensors everywhere. Every smartphone is a sense organ. Cameras are eyes. Microphones are ears. GPS tracks movement. Accelerometers feel motion. Billions of sensors feeding data streams. The planet grows aware.

Social media as consciousness stream. Twitter thoughts flashing globally. News spreading faster than comprehension. Memes as shared mental patterns. Hashtags as focused attention. Collective consciousness emerging from individual posts.

Response mechanisms activate. Disaster strikes, aid coordinates online. Protests organize through encrypted messages. Markets react in milliseconds. The nervous system doesn't just sense - it responds. Planetary reflexes develop.

But whose nervous system? No central brain controls it. We're neurons arguing about what the body should do. The internet awakens but stays schizophrenic. Multiple personalities, no unified self. A nervous system seeking its mind.
