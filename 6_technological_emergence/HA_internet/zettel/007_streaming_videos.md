# Streaming Videos

## Core Insight
Streaming video transformed the internet from library to theater - from pulling information to having experiences pushed to us.

Remember downloading videos? Hours for a movie, minutes for a clip. We'd start downloads before bed, hoping they'd finish by morning. Storage mattered. "Delete something to make room" was the constant refrain. Videos were precious because they cost time and space.

Then YouTube changed everything. Click and watch. No download, no wait (mostly). Videos became disposable, infinite. We went from scarcity to abundance overnight. The psychological shift was profound - why save anything when you can stream it anytime?

But streaming is a magic trick. You're not watching a video - you're watching pieces of video arriving just in time. Your player is assembling fragments into seamless experience. It's like building a road microseconds before the car drives on it. One hiccup and the illusion breaks.

Streaming made video social. Comments, likes, shares - all possible because we're watching from servers, not files. The video exists in one place while millions access it simultaneously. We're not watching copies; we're sharing views of the same thing.

The culture shifted. "Did you see that video?" became universal conversation. Viral wasn't just popular - it was synchronized global experience. Millions watching the same clip within hours. Streaming created the first real-time global visual culture.
