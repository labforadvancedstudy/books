# Bandwidth

## Core Insight
Bandwidth is the width of the pipe through which the internet flows - determining not just speed but what kinds of digital experiences are possible.

Dial-up's 56k meant choosing: download a song OR browse the web. Not both. Bandwidth scarcity shaped behavior. We compressed images, avoided video, built lightweight sites. The internet was text because text fit through narrow pipes.

Broadband changed everything. Always-on connections meant the web became ambient. Megabits per second enabled YouTube. Streaming replaced downloading. We stopped thinking about bandwidth until it vanished. Then we remembered: bandwidth is possibility.

The inequality persists. Urban gigabit fiber vs rural satellite. First world problems ("only" 100Mbps) vs developing nations rationing megabytes. Bandwidth is economic opportunity. Fast internet enables remote work, education, participation. Slow internet means digital exclusion.

Mobile complicated everything. 4G made phones primary internet devices. 5G promises more bandwidth than fiber. But mobile bandwidth costs more, caps lower. We learned to switch between WiFi and cellular, to manage our bit budget.

Bandwidth shapes culture. High bandwidth cultures stream 4K video casually. Low bandwidth cultures master compression, caching, offline modes. The internet isn't one thing - it's many internets divided by connection speed. Bandwidth is destiny.
