# Typing URLs

## Core Insight
URLs are spells - incantations we type to summon specific realities from the void.

In the beginning, we typed every character: http://www.example.com/page.html. Each piece had meaning. The protocol (http), the subdomain (www), the domain (example.com), the path (/page.html). We were invoking specific resources on specific machines using specific methods.

Then came convenience. Browsers started assuming "http://www." We stopped typing it. Search bars merged with URL bars - type words or addresses, the browser figures it out. The precision of early web gave way to fuzzy navigation. We Google instead of going.

But something was lost. URLs were addresses in the truest sense - they told you where you were in the web's geography. Deep URLs like site.com/section/subsection/article were breadcrumbs. Now we have short URLs, URL shorteners, URLs that hide their true destination. We navigate blindly.

The muscle memory remains. Power users still type URLs directly. Ctrl+L, type, enter. It's faster than clicking, more direct than searching. For those who know the web's true names, typing URLs is teleportation. No intermediaries, no algorithms - just you and the destination.

URL typos created empires. Googel.com, facebok.com - these mistakes get millions of visits. Typosquatters know: URLs are valuable real estate, and human fingers are imperfect.
