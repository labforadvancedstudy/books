# Digital Privacy

## Core Insight
Digital privacy is the paradox of wanting connection without observation - seeking to be known but not surveilled, understood but not tracked, social but not transparent.

Privacy meant something different before the internet. Close your door, pull your curtains, done. Digital privacy is harder. Every click logged. Every search saved. Every site tracking. Your browser fingerprint is unique among millions. You're never alone online.

The bargain seemed fair initially. Free services for targeted ads. Convenience for data. Connection for transparency. Then we learned the price. Data breaches. Manipulation. Surveillance capitalism. We traded privacy for trinkets.

Encryption fights back. HTTPS everywhere. Signal for messaging. VPNs for browsing. Tor for anonymity. But using privacy tools marks you as suspicious. The very act of seeking privacy reduces it. Paradox within paradox.

GDPR tried legislating privacy. Cookie banners everywhere. Right to deletion. Data portability. But clicking "accept all" became muscle memory. Privacy theater replaced privacy practice. Laws can't fix what culture accepts.

The generational divide is real. Digital natives share everything. Privacy seems antiquated. "I have nothing to hide." But privacy isn't about hiding - it's about choosing. When everything is public, nothing is special. Intimacy requires boundaries.
