# Filter Bubbles

## Core Insight
Filter bubbles are reality fragmenting - algorithms showing you more of what you already believe, creating billions of parallel universes where everyone is right.

Eli Pariser warned us. Personalized search means different people get different results for the same query. Personalized feeds mean we see different news. The same internet becomes different internets. We're not browsing the web - we're browsing our web.

The algorithm's logic is sound: show people what they engage with. But engagement correlates with confirmation. We click what confirms our beliefs. The algorithm learns. The bubble thickens. Eventually, other viewpoints don't just seem wrong - they become invisible.

Facebook's feed, Google's results, YouTube's recommendations - all filtered. Not censorship but curation. Except the curator is an algorithm optimizing for engagement, not truth or completeness. We asked for relevance and got resonance.

Breaking filter bubbles is hard. Intentionally seeking opposing views feels like work. The algorithm fights back, quickly reverting to comfort content. We're in a tug-of-war with systems designed to give us what we want, when what we want might be destroying us.

The scariest part: we can't see our own bubble from inside. Fish don't know they're wet. We don't know what we're not seeing. The unknown unknowns multiply. Shared reality splinters into incompatible shards.
