# Edge Computing

## Core Insight
Edge computing brings computation closer to data sources - reversing cloud centralization by processing information where it's created rather than shipping it to distant data centers.

The cloud pulled everything to the center. Edge computing pushes back out. It's the realization that physics still matters - light has speed limits, networks have latency, and sometimes you need answers NOW, not in 100 milliseconds.

Your smart doorbell doesn't send video to AWS to recognize faces. It does it locally, at the edge. Your car doesn't ask the cloud whether to brake. Autonomous decisions need autonomous computing. The edge is where digital meets physical with no time for round trips.

5G isn't just faster phones - it's edge computing infrastructure. Cell towers becoming mini data centers. Computing dispersed like seeds, sprouting wherever data grows. The network topology inverting from hub-and-spoke to mesh, intelligence everywhere.

But edge creates new problems. How do you update a million tiny computers? How do you secure devices you can't physically access? How do you coordinate when the center disappears? The edge is wild, untamed, full of promise and peril.
