# Interface Evolution

## Core Insight
Interfaces evolve toward invisibility - from command lines to mice to touchscreens to voice to thought, each generation hiding more complexity behind simpler interaction.

Command line was honest. Type commands, see results. No metaphors, no pretense. You talked to the computer in its language. Brutal but clear. Power users still prefer it. The terminal never lies.

GUI revolution made computers democratic. Point and click. Drag and drop. Metaphors everywhere - desktops, folders, trash cans. We taught computers to pretend they were offices. Skeuomorphism made digital feel physical. Buttons looked pushable.

Touch changed everything. No more intermediary devices. Finger meets screen. Direct manipulation. Pinch to zoom felt natural because it was. We stopped clicking buttons, started touching information. The interface became invisible.

Voice is conquering. "Hey Siri," "OK Google," "Alexa" - we speak and they obey. No screens necessary. The interface became conversation. But also surveillance. Always listening interfaces know too much.

Brain-computer interfaces loom. Neuralink promises thought-control. Skip voice, skip touch, think and it happens. The ultimate invisible interface. Also the ultimate invasion. When interface enters your skull, where's the boundary between you and machine?

Each evolution reduces friction but increases intimacy. Interfaces don't just become easier - they become part of us.
