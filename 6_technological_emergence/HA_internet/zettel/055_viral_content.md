# Viral Content

## Core Insight
Viral content is the internet's evolution in action - ideas competing for the scarce resource of human attention, with shareability as fitness function.

The virus metaphor is perfect. Content infects a host (viewer), who spreads it to others. Some content has R0 > 1 (each viewer shares with more than one person), spreading exponentially. Most has R0 < 1, dying quickly. Natural selection for memes.

Emotions drive virality. Anger spreads fastest, followed by awe, anxiety, and joy. Sadness doesn't spread - who shares depression? The emotional immune system of the internet selects for activation, not accuracy. Truth is optional; feeling is essential.

Timing matters. The same content posted at different times has different fates. Monday morning vs Friday night. During news cycles vs quiet periods. The internet's attention has rhythms. Virality requires not just good content but good timing.

Influencers are super-spreaders. One share from a million-follower account can make anything viral. This creates power dynamics. Attention kingmakers who charge for access to their audience. The democratization of media re-centralized around new gatekeepers.

But virality is ephemeral. Today's sensation is tomorrow's forgotten link. The internet's memory is short, attention shorter. Viral content burns bright and dies fast. The price of massive reach is minimal persistence.
