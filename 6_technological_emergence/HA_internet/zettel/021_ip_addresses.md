# IP Addresses

## Core Insight
IP addresses are the internet's phone numbers - unique identifiers that make the global network possible by giving every device a findable location.

Internet Protocol addresses seem boring - just numbers like 192.168.1.1. But these numbers are civilization-enabling. Without unique addresses, no routing. Without routing, no internet. Just isolated computers talking to themselves.

IPv4 gave us 4.3 billion addresses. Seemed infinite in 1981. By 2011, we ran out. The internet's first existential crisis. IPv6 solved it with 340 undecillion addresses - enough to assign multiple addresses to every atom on Earth. We learned to think bigger.

Your IP address reveals more than you think. Geographic location, internet provider, sometimes organization. VPNs exist because IP addresses are identity. Change your IP, change your digital nationality. The address became political.

Dynamic vs static tells another story. Most users get new IPs regularly (dynamic). Servers need permanent addresses (static). This division creates two classes - the served and the servers. Your home IP changes; Google's doesn't.

NAT (Network Address Translation) created IP inequality. Your router has one public IP, shares it among all devices using private IPs. We're running out of IPv4 because we're hiding millions of devices behind single addresses. Digital apartment buildings.
