# Internet Governance

## Core Insight
Internet governance is the paradox of organizing anarchy - creating just enough structure to enable freedom without crushing it.

Who runs the internet? Everyone and no one. ICANN manages domain names. IETF develops protocols. W3C sets web standards. Regional registries allocate IPs. But no single authority controls it all. Governance by rough consensus and running code.

The multi-stakeholder model emerged. Governments, companies, civil society, technical community - all have voices. Not democracy exactly, but not dictatorship either. Messy, slow, but resilient. The internet routes around damage, including damaged governance.

Nation-states push back. China's Great Firewall, Russia's sovereign internet, EU's GDPR. Each trying to impose borders on the borderless. Digital sovereignty versus internet freedom. The splinternet threatens - one internet becoming many.

Standards bodies walk tightropes. Open enough for innovation, structured enough for interoperability. RFC (Request for Comments) culture - propose, discuss, implement. Authority through expertise, not force. The cathedral and bazaar in balance.

The real governance is code. Protocols are policy. Architecture is law. What the code allows shapes behavior more than any regulation. Lawrence Lessig was right: code is law. Programmers are unelected legislators.
