# ISPs

## Core Insight
Internet Service Providers are the bridge trolls of the digital age - controlling the physical infrastructure that connects homes to the global network, with power to grant or deny passage.

Your ISP is your internet gatekeeper. They own the last mile - that crucial cable from the internet backbone to your house. It's feudalism in fiber optic form. You don't choose your lord; geography does. One cable, one company, one choice: pay or stay offline.

The asymmetry is intentional. Fast downloads, slow uploads. They want you consuming, not creating. The infrastructure could be symmetric, but the business model isn't. You're a customer, not a peer. The internet's democratic promise meets capitalism's hierarchical reality.

Net neutrality wars are about this power. Should ISPs be dumb pipes or smart filters? Should they see what you're doing or just deliver bits? Every packet equal, or some more equal than others? The answer shapes whether the internet remains open or becomes cable TV 2.0.

ISPs know everything: when you wake (phone checks email), when you sleep (Netflix stops), what you search (DNS queries), who you are (billing address). They're not just infrastructure providers - they're surveillance checkpoints, data merchants, power brokers.
