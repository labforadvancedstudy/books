# Data Centers

## Core Insight
Data centers are the internet's physical reality - massive buildings where the cloud touches ground, consuming the energy of small cities to maintain our digital lives.

The cloud has addresses. Facebook lives in Prineville. Google sprawls across Council Bluffs. Amazon occupies Northern Virginia. These aren't offices but fortresses - biometric security, redundant power, elaborate cooling. Fort Knox for bits.

The scale breaks comprehension. Millions of servers. Exabytes of storage. Enough network cable to circle Earth. Each data center is a city of machines, humming at frequencies we interpret as cat videos and credit card transactions.

Cooling is the hidden challenge. Computers are heaters that happen to calculate. Data centers spend fortunes moving heat - liquid cooling, hot aisle/cold aisle designs, locating in cold climates or near rivers. The internet runs hot. Global warming includes actual computational warming.

But data centers enable magic. Your photo uploads to "the cloud" - really server #7,834 in rack R47 in building 3 in Ashburn, Virginia. Redundantly copied to Dublin and Singapore. Available instantly worldwide. Physical location abstracted to irrelevance.

The paradox: the more virtual our lives, the more physical infrastructure required. Every tweet needs a home. Every search needs servers. The internet isn't ethereal - it's tons of metal consuming gigawatts of power.
