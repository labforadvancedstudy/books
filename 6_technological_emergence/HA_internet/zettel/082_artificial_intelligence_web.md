# Artificial Intelligence Web

## Core Insight
AI is eating the web from inside - algorithms learning to read, write, see, and decide, transforming the internet from human playground to hybrid ecosystem.

First, AI learned to filter. Spam detection, content moderation, recommendation engines. We taught machines to decide what we should see. The web became curated by non-human intelligence. We outsourced judgment to algorithms.

Then AI learned to create. GPT writes articles. DALL-E makes images. Deepfakes forge videos. The web fills with content no human made. We can't tell anymore. Every image might be AI. Every comment might be bot. Reality becomes negotiable.

Search transformed. Google doesn't just find pages - it answers questions. Sometimes accurately. AI mediates between human curiosity and web content. We stopped browsing results, started trusting summaries. The oracle speaks with statistical confidence.

The feedback loops accelerate. AI trains on web content. Web content includes AI output. AI trains on AI. The ouroboros of machine learning. Each generation learns from the previous, accumulating biases, amplifying patterns. The web becomes AI's training data and output simultaneously.

The question looms: when does the web stop being for humans? When AI creates most content, curates all feeds, answers all questions - who is the web serving? We built a communication network that increasingly talks to itself.
