# Email

## Core Insight
Email is the internet's first killer app - transforming human communication from synchronous conversation to asynchronous correspondence.

Ray Tomlinson picked @ because it was unlikely to appear in names. user@host. Simple, elegant, eternal. This addressing scheme outlasted every communication platform that tried to kill email. The @ symbol went from obscurity to universal recognition.

Email liberated communication from time zones. Send thoughts while they sleep, receive responses while you dream. The global conversation became possible. Business transformed. "Get back to me" no longer meant phone tag but thoughtful written response.

But email also enslaved. The inbox became a todo list controlled by others. Email bankruptcy - declaring inbox zero impossible - entered our vocabulary. We went from checking email to living in it. The average worker spends 28% of their time on email.

Spam nearly killed it. By 2004, 90% of email was spam. Filters evolved from keywords to AI. We built intelligence systems just to find real messages among fake. The arms race continues - spammers evolve, filters adapt, inbox remains battlefield.

Yet email persists. Every "email killer" - Slack, WhatsApp, whatever - requires email to sign up. It's the protocol that refuses to die, the cockroach of communication. Decentralized, resilient, universal. Email is forever.
