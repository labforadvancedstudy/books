# Notifications

## Core Insight
Notifications are the internet's nervous system reporting to consciousness - every ping a synapse firing in the global brain.

The red badge. The banner dropping down. The gentle buzz. Notifications hijacked our attention systems with surgical precision. They exploit our deepest evolutionary wiring - the need to respond to environmental changes. Every notification triggers the same ancient circuits that once detected predators.

We invited them in. "Allow notifications?" Yes, we said, not knowing we were agreeing to perpetual interruption. Now they rule us. The average person receives 60-80 phone notifications daily. Each one fractures focus, demands decision, creates micro-stress.

But notifications also connect. They're how the asynchronous web becomes synchronous life. Someone liked your photo in Tokyo, commented on your post in Lagos, messaged you from next door - all arriving instantly. We're nodes in a network, and notifications are the signals keeping us synchronized.

The arms race escalated. Apps compete for notification permission like territory. Each one claims importance. Breaking news! New message! Update available! The mundane masquerades as urgent. We've created attention inflation - everything screams for notice, so nothing gets noticed.

Yet turning them off feels like digital death. No notifications means no connection, no relevance, no existence in the network. We're caught between distraction and disconnection, pinging between the two states.
