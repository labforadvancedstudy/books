# Network Effects

## Core Insight
Network effects are economic gravity - the more massive a network becomes, the more powerfully it attracts new members, creating inescapable digital black holes.

Metcalfe's Law quantified it: network value grows with the square of users. Two phones can make one connection. Five phones make ten. A million phones make 499,999,500,000 connections. Value explodes exponentially. Mathematics creates monopoly.

The telephone taught us first. One phone is useless. Two phones have value. Every additional phone increases value for all. But digital networks accelerated this. Adding users costs nothing. Scaling is free. Network effects on steroids.

Social networks perfected it. Facebook without friends is worthless. Each friend who joins adds value. But also lock-in. Leave Facebook? Leave your network. The Hotel California of the internet - you can check out but never leave.

Two-sided networks doubled the effect. eBay needs buyers AND sellers. Uber needs drivers AND riders. Each side attracts the other. Empty marketplaces stay empty. Full marketplaces get fuller. The rich get richer.

Breaking network effects seems impossible. Google+ had Google's might, still failed. No features matter if the network's not there. This creates stagnation. Why innovate when network effects protect you? The gravity well traps everyone.
