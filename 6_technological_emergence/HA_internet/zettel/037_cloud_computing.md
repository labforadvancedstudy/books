# Cloud Computing

## Core Insight
Cloud computing is the industrialization of computing - transforming servers from owned objects to rented utilities, like electricity or water.

"There is no cloud, it's just someone else's computer" - the meme that misses the point. Yes, they're computers. But computers you never see, never maintain, never worry about. Scale up for Christmas, scale down in January. Pay for what you use. It's not about ownership - it's about abstraction.

The real innovation isn't technology - it's economics. Capital expenditure becomes operational expenditure. Fixed costs become variable. Startups can access supercomputer power with a credit card. David can fight Goliath because they're renting the same slingshots from Amazon.

Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, Software as a Service - layers of abstraction, each hiding more complexity. By the time you reach serverless, you're not even thinking about servers. Just functions floating in digital space, materializing when called.

But dependence has a price. When AWS hiccups, half the internet holds its breath. We've traded many single points of failure for a few massive ones. The cloud providers are utilities now - too big to fail, too powerful to regulate, too convenient to resist.
