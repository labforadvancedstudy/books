# Microservices

## Core Insight
Microservices decompose applications into tiny, independent services - each doing one thing well, like digital specialized organs working together to form a living system.

The monolith is dead. Long live the swarm. Instead of one giant application, build a hundred tiny ones. Each microservice is a specialist: authentication service, payment service, notification service. Like evolution discovering multicellularity.

Netflix doesn't have a video streaming application. It has hundreds of microservices choreographing a dance. One finds what you want to watch. Another checks if you're allowed. Another locates the video. Another starts streaming. Another tracks what you watched. All independent, all coordinated.

The beauty: change one service without touching others. The horror: debugging across service boundaries. A single button click might touch 50 microservices. When something breaks, which one failed? Distributed systems are hard. Distributed debugging is harder.

But microservices mirror how we think, how organizations work, how biology evolved. Specialization enables complexity. Small teams own small services. Deploy independently. Fail independently. Scale independently. It's Conway's Law in code - software architecture mirrors organizational architecture.
