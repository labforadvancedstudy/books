# Language and Thought

## Core Insight
Language doesn't just express thought - it shapes and constrains what thoughts are possible. Programming languages prove this daily.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis claims human language influences human thought. Eskimos (supposedly) have many words for snow, so they perceive snow differently. This is debated for human languages, but for programming languages? It's undeniable.

A C programmer thinks in pointers and memory addresses. A Lisp programmer thinks in lists and recursion. A Prolog programmer thinks in logical relations. The language you use rewires your brain.

Try explaining closures to a C programmer. Try explaining manual memory management to a Python programmer. It's not just that the languages lack these features - it's that prolonged use of a language without these concepts makes them feel alien, unnecessary, even wrong.

```python
# Python programmer's natural thought
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = [n**2 for n in numbers]
```

```c
// C programmer's natural thought  
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int squared[5];
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    squared[i] = numbers[i] * numbers[i];
}
```

Same problem, radically different mental models. The Python programmer thinks "transform each element." The C programmer thinks "iterate through indices."

The terrifying implication: if programming languages shape programmer thought this strongly, what are human languages doing to us? What thoughts are impossible in English but natural in Haskell?
