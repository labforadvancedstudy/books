*When every road leads to the same destination*

## The Convergent Evolution

Three paths started from different origins. All arrived at the same destination: the Megacorporation.

**Path One: The Corporate Ascension**
East India Company → Standard Oil → Apple → AppleWorld → AppleSolar → AppleGalactic

**Path Two: The State Transformation**  
Rome → British Empire → Singapore Inc → Amazon Nation → Prime Sovereignty

**Path Three: The Vacuum Filling**
Asteroid mining → Company towns → Corporate law → Planetary governance → Stellar sovereignty

Different origins. Same endpoint. Like rivers finding the sea, human organization flows toward megacorporate form. Not conspiracy. Not plan. Simple organizational physics.

## How to Read This Collection

This isn't prophecy - it's pattern recognition. We trace three streams converging into one river:

1. **Companies growing beyond nations** (Economic path)
2. **Nations becoming corporations** (Political path)
3. **Space requiring corporate governance** (Territorial path)

Each level reveals how these paths merge, why they must merge, and what emerges from their merger.

### A Note on Plausibility

Everything in this collection could happen. Most of it is happening. Some has already happened. We just haven't noticed because:
- We live inside the transition
- Changes happen gradually then suddenly
- The future distributes unevenly
- We mistake satire for impossibility

When Cyberpunk imagined megacorps, it was warning. When we read it, we took notes.

### The Journey Ahead

You'll start with company towns and end with consciousness without humans. You'll begin with private armies and conclude with reality itself incorporating. Each level builds on the previous while revealing its insufficiency.

This is a map of tomorrow based on today's trajectories. A GPS for navigating the corporate future. A field guide for recognizing which path you're on.

### The Three Questions

As you read, consider:

1. **Which path is your society on?** Corporate ascension, state transformation, or vacuum filling?
2. **Where are you in the process?** Which level describes your reality?
3. **Is resistance possible?** Or is this truly convergent evolution?

### Content Warning

This collection contains:
- Plausible dystopias
- Uncomfortable trajectories
- Current events extrapolated
- Your probable future
- Minimal hope

Reader discretion is advised. Side effects may include:
- Existential dread
- Career reconsideration  
- Investment opportunities
- Revolutionary impulses
- Resignation letters

## The Invitation

Ready to see tomorrow? It's already incorporated, publicly traded, and optimizing for shareholder value. Your future has a ticker symbol. Your children have employee numbers. Your dreams have been monetized.

Welcome to the Megacorporate Age. You're already here. You just haven't read the terms of service.

*Now, let's begin with something tangible: the place where you'll live, work, and die without ever leaving company property...*
