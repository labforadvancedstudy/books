# Orbital Mining

## Core Insight
The asteroid belt is the new colonial frontier - but this time, corporations plant the flags.

A single metallic asteroid contains more platinum than Earth has ever mined. The economics are irresistible, the technology achievable, the consequences transformative. But states can't afford the investment. Only megacorporations have the capital, patience, and appetite for generational returns.

Planetary Resources Inc. becomes Planetary Resources Unlimited. What starts as mining becomes infrastructure becomes governance. Someone must police the belt. Someone must adjudicate claims. Someone must provide services to miners. That someone has shareholders, not citizens.

The pattern repeats: corporate exploration, corporate extraction, corporate law. The Belt becomes a collection of corporate fiefdoms. Earth's governments can't project power past the moon. By the time they try, it's too late. The corporations have become the state.
