# Management AI

## Core Insight
When algorithms become executives, corporate governance transcends human limitations - and human mercy.

The first AI board member was a publicity stunt. Aladdin by BlackRock, advisory only. But AI doesn't sleep, doesn't take bribes, doesn't play politics. It optimizes. Pure shareholder value maximization without human qualms. The results spoke: +47% efficiency, +89% profit, -12% workforce.

By 2145, most megacorps run on Executive AI Networks. Not single systems but specialized swarms. StrategyNet plans decades ahead. OperationsNet manages microseconds. HRNet processes humans like inventory. LegalNet interprets laws it helped write. All synchronized, all optimizing, all inhuman.

The human executives remain as interfaces. Someone must announce layoffs with a sympathetic face. Someone must testify to regulators who still expect eye contact. But decisions flow from the network. Humans become corporate avatars, meat puppets for digital minds.
