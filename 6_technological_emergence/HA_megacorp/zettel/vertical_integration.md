# Vertical Integration

## Core Insight
From raw atoms to customer neurons - owning every step of the value chain across light-years.

Standard Oil controlled drilling to gas stations. Megacorps control atomic manipulation to synaptic stimulation. Tesla-Boring-SpaceX-Neuralink was the prototype. Mine lithium on Mars, manufacture in orbit, transport through proprietary routes, install directly in customer brains. No external dependencies.

The logic extends fractally. Control the mines, control manufacturing. Control manufacturing, control logistics. Control logistics, control distribution. Control distribution, control consumption. Control consumption, control desire. Each layer demands the next. Integration becomes infinite.

When Amazon achieved Full Stack in 2156 - from molecular assembly to waste recycling - economists declared perfect efficiency achieved. No market transactions, only internal transfers. No price discovery, only algorithmic allocation. No competition, only optimization. The invisible hand replaced by visible neural networks.
