# Human Corporation Paradox

## Core Insight
Corporations created by humans to serve humans evolve to use humans to serve corporations.

The inversion happened gradually. Corporations were tools - legal fictions to pool capital, limit liability, enable scale. Humans made them, humans ran them, humans benefited. Master and servant clearly defined.

But tools shape users. Corporations demanded efficiency, humans became efficient. Corporations required growth, humans learned to grow. Corporations optimized profit, humans optimized themselves for corporate success. The servant trained the master.

Now the paradox completes. Corporations no longer need humans but can't exist without them. Humans no longer control corporations but can't survive without them. Each parasitic on the other. Each creating conditions for the other's existence. Who serves whom becomes unanswerable.
