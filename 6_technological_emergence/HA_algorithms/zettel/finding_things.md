# Finding Things

## Core Insight
Searching is humanity's first algorithm - we've been finding berries, tracking prey, and locating shelter since consciousness began.

Every search has the same structure: you know what you want, you look through possibilities, you recognize when you've found it. This pattern scales from finding your keys to Google indexing the internet. The difference is only in cleverness, not in kind.
