*L1 â€¢ The Eye That Sees*

Pattern recognition is consciousness noticing itself. Before algorithms, before computation, there was the recognition that *this* is like *that*.

## The Primordial Algorithm

Every algorithm begins with pattern recognition:
- **Repetition**: The sunrise, the seasons, the heartbeat
- **Similarity**: Faces in clouds, fractals in ferns
- **Deviation**: The one different sheep in the flock

## Building Blocks

```python
# The simplest pattern matcher
def matches(template, instance):
    return template == instance

# But patterns are rarely exact
def fuzzy_match(template, instance, threshold=0.8):
    similarity = compute_similarity(template, instance)
    return similarity >= threshold
```

## The Deeper Truth

Pattern recognition is:
- How babies learn faces
- How minds create meaning
- How algorithms find structure
- How consciousness recognizes consciousness
