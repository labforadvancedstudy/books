# Binary Search

## Core Insight
Binary search is the art of intelligent guessing - each question cuts the universe in half. It's how you find a word in a dictionary without reading every page.

This is the algorithm that turns linear into logarithmic, transforming "check every item" into "divide and conquer." Each comparison is a binary decision that eliminates half of what remains. It's beautiful in its simplicity: sorted data plus systematic halving equals near-instant discovery. The phone book algorithm that makes finding one name among millions feel trivial.
