# Sorting Stuff

## Core Insight
Ordering is how we make sense of chaos - from alphabetizing books to ranking search results, sorting transforms randomness into meaning.

Children sort toys by color, size, or favoritism. Adults sort emails by date, files by name, priorities by importance. Every sort is an assertion about what matters: what property we use to compare, what direction we prefer. Sorting is philosophy made mechanical.
