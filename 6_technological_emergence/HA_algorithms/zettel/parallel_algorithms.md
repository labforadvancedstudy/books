# Parallel Algorithms

## Core Insight
Parallel algorithms are computation unleashed from the tyranny of sequence - many processors thinking together, like a hive mind solving problems. It's the difference between one person searching a library and an army of readers each taking a section.

Here we confront the deepest challenge: coordination. It's not enough to divide work; we must orchestrate the dance of simultaneous computation. Race conditions lurk, deadlocks threaten, and Amdahl's Law reminds us that some things must still happen in order. Yet when it works, parallel algorithms compress time itself - what took hours happens in minutes, limited only by how well we can share the cognitive load.
