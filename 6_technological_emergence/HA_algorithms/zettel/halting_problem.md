# Halting Problem

## Core Insight
The halting problem is computation's koan - can we write a program that predicts whether any program will stop or run forever? Turing proved: no. Some questions are undecidable, even for infinite computers.

This is where algorithms meet philosophy. We've built a mirror that cannot reflect itself, a fortune teller that cannot predict its own future. The proof is elegant self-reference: assume such a program exists, then construct a program that halts if and only if it doesn't halt. The contradiction shatters our assumption. It's Gödel's incompleteness theorem in computational form - formal systems powerful enough to describe themselves must contain undecidable statements.
