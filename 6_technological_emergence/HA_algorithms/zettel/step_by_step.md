# Step by Step

## Core Insight
Every algorithm is just a recipe - a series of steps that even a child can follow.

When you give someone directions to your house, you're creating an algorithm. When you follow a cooking recipe, you're executing one. The profound truth is that all computation, from calculators to AI, is just following steps - one after another, reliably, predictably.

The magic isn't in any single step. It's in the fact that simple steps, combined correctly, can solve any solvable problem in the universe.
