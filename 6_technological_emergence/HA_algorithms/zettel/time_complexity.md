# Time Complexity

## Core Insight
Time complexity is prophecy through mathematics - predicting how an algorithm will slow as data grows. It's not about seconds, but about scaling.

We write O(n) and see the future: double the input, double the time. O(n²) warns of doom: double the input, quadruple the suffering. Big-O notation strips away the machine, the language, the implementation details, leaving only the essential truth: how does this algorithm grow? It's the physics of computation, where n approaches infinity and constants disappear.
