# Level 0: Everyday Algorithms - The Unconscious Computing
*You've been running algorithms since before you could talk*

## You Are Already A Computer

Right now, as you read this, you're executing one of the most sophisticated algorithms ever developed: natural language processing. You're:
1. Scanning symbols left to right (in English)
2. Matching patterns to your mental dictionary
3. Assembling meaning from components
4. Updating your mental state
5. Deciding whether to continue

You've been computing all along. You just called it "reading."

## The Morning Algorithm

Let's trace through a typical morning. You wake up. What happens next?

```
MORNING_ROUTINE:
  IF (alarm ringing):
    WHILE (not fully awake):
      hit snooze
      wait 9 minutes
  
  check time
  calculate (time available - time needed)
  
  IF (result < 0):
    activate PANIC_MODE
    skip optional_steps[]
  ELSE:
    execute standard_routine[]
```

You don't think about it this way, but you're running a complex decision tree with real-time optimization. You're continuously evaluating trade-offs: more sleep vs. breakfast, shower vs. being late, coffee now vs. coffee to-go.

## Finding Your Keys: Humanity's First Search Algorithm

The "where are my keys?" algorithm is a masterpiece of adaptive search:

**The Systematic Search:**
1. Check the usual spots (cache lookup)
2. Retrace yesterday's steps (backtracking)
3. Look in pockets of yesterday's clothes (historical data)
4. Ask family members (distributed processing)
5. Panic and dump out bag (brute force)

Notice how you naturally escalate from efficient strategies to exhaustive ones. You've independently invented:
- **Caching**: Check likely spots first
- **Heuristics**: Use past patterns
- **Parallel processing**: Recruit help
- **Exhaustive search**: Last resort

## The Grocery Store: A Sorting Masterclass

Watch yourself shop. You're running multiple algorithms simultaneously:

**The List Algorithm:**
- Some people traverse the list linearly
- Others sort by store layout (optimization)
- Advanced shoppers maintain a mental map and compute shortest path

**The Decision Algorithm:**
```
FOR each item needed:
  find location
  IF (preferred brand available):
    IF (price acceptable):
      add to cart
    ELSE:
      evaluate alternatives
  ELSE:
    execute substitution_protocol
```

**The Checkout Choice:**
Which line do you pick? You're running a real-time optimization:
- Count items in each cart (workload estimation)
- Evaluate cashier speed (processor benchmarking)  
- Factor in self-checkout (parallel processing option)
- Make prediction and commit

Sometimes you switch lines. That's dynamic load balancing!

## Making Dinner: The Recipe Algorithm

A recipe is literally an algorithm written for humans:

```
SPAGHETTI_AGLIO_E_OLIO:
  ingredients = [spaghetti, garlic, olive_oil, chili, parsley]
  
  START boiling water     // Parallel process 1
  WHILE (water heating):  // Utilize wait time
    mince garlic
    chop parsley
    
  ADD pasta to boiling water
  SET timer for (package_time - 1 minute)
  
  WHILE (pasta cooking):  // Parallel process 2
    heat olive_oil
    add garlic
    WHEN (garlic golden):
      add chili
      remove from heat
      
  WHEN (timer rings):
    reserve pasta_water
    drain pasta
    combine all ingredients
    
  SERVE immediately
```

Notice the optimizations:
- Parallel processing (water heats while you prep)
- Resource management (reserve pasta water)
- Time-critical operations (garlic can burn)
- Pipeline optimization (everything ready simultaneously)

## Social Navigation: The Pathfinding of Parties

At a party, you run sophisticated social algorithms:

**The Mingling Algorithm:**
1. Enter room, scan for familiar faces (pattern matching)
2. Plot path avoiding awkward encounters (obstacle avoidance)
3. Join group with optimal comfort/interest ratio
4. Monitor conversation energy
5. Execute graceful exit when energy drops
6. Repeat

You're solving a dynamic traveling salesman problem with constantly changing weights!

## The Bedtime Recursion

Getting kids to bed is literally recursion with multiple base cases:

```
PUT_KID_TO_BED(child):
  child.brush_teeth()
  child.put_on_pajamas()
  child.get_in_bed()
  
  WHILE (child.awake):
    IF (child.wants_water):
      get_water()
    ELSE IF (child.needs_bathroom):
      escort_to_bathroom()
    ELSE IF (child.scared):
      check_for_monsters()
    ELSE IF (child.wants_story):
      IF (stories_told < 3):
        read_story()
        stories_told++
      ELSE:
        firmly_say_no()
    
    PUT_KID_TO_BED(child)  // Recursive call
```

Base case: child.asleep == true (eventually... hopefully...)

## The Phone Check: An Interrupt Handler

Your phone buzzes. Watch what happens:

1. Current task suspended
2. Context saved (mental bookmark)
3. Switch to phone context
4. Process notification
5. Decide: urgent or ignorable?
6. Either handle now or queue for later
7. Restore previous context
8. Resume original task

You're implementing interrupt handling and context switching, core concepts in operating systems!

## Decision Trees in Daily Life

Every choice is an algorithm:

**What to Wear:**
- Check weather (input data)
- Consider day's activities (requirements analysis)
- Evaluate clean options (resource availability)
- Optimize for comfort/appearance (multi-objective optimization)

**What to Eat for Lunch:**
- Hunger level? (system state)
- Time available? (resource constraint)
- Budget? (another constraint)
- Recent meals? (avoid repetition)
- Nearby options? (spatial query)

You solve constraint satisfaction problems dozens of times daily!

## The Beautiful Truth

Here's what's remarkable: every human, regardless of education, runs these algorithms. A grandmother organizing her recipe box is doing database indexing. A child playing hide-and-seek is experimenting with search algorithms. A commuter choosing routes is solving optimization problems.

We are all computers. Biological, messy, brilliant computers running algorithms evolved over millions of years and refined through culture and experience.

The algorithms in the rest of this book? They're just these same patterns, formalized and optimized for silicon instead of neurons.

## The Real Mystery Is...

Why do these algorithms feel so natural?

Think about it: there's no reason that step-by-step thinking should work. Why should breaking problems down help? Why should trying the same spots first (caching) be effective? Why does the universe have patterns that repeat?

We take it for granted that recipes work, that searching systematically finds things, that sorting helps. But this is profound: **the universe is algorithmic**. It has regularities, patterns, consistencies that allow prediction and planning.

A child learning to walk is discovering that the same movements produce the same results. That's the foundational assumption of all computing: **determinism**. Do the same thing, get the same result.

But here's the kicker: you're using algorithms to understand algorithms. The very fact that you can learn about computation is because your brain computes. We're algorithms studying ourselves.

And somehow, that works. The universe is comprehensible to minds that evolved in it. The cosmic algorithm produced brains that can discover algorithms.

That's not obvious. That's miraculous.
