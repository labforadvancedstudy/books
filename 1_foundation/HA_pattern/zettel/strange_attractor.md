# Strange Attractor

## Core Insight
The hidden order in chaos - a geometric shape in phase space that chaotic systems trace but never repeat.

Strange attractors are chaos theory's most beautiful paradox. A system sensitive to initial conditions, completely unpredictable in detail, yet confined to trace the same shape forever. Like a butterfly eternally retracing its wings without ever flying the same path twice.

The Lorenz attractor showed us weather's shape. The Rössler attractor revealed chemical chaos. These aren't random - they're deterministic systems painting precise forms with infinite variation.
