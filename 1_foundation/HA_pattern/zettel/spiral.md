# Spiral

## Core Insight
The pattern of growth and return - nature's way of combining linear progress with circular rhythm.

Spirals are everywhere because they solve a fundamental problem: how to grow while maintaining connection to the center. Galaxies spiral to conserve angular momentum. Shells spiral to maximize strength with minimal material. DNA spirals to pack information efficiently.

The logarithmic spiral is nature's favorite - each turn expands by a constant factor. This creates self-similarity: the spiral looks the same at every scale. From nautilus shells to hurricanes, the same mathematical pattern appears.
