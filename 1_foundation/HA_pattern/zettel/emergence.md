# Emergence

## Core Insight
When patterns create new patterns - the magic moment where quantitative accumulation becomes qualitative transformation.

Emergence is pattern birthing pattern. Neurons firing in patterns create thoughts. Thoughts combining in patterns create consciousness. Individual behaviors in patterns create culture. Simple rules yield complex outcomes that can't be predicted from the rules alone.

The key: emergence isn't just complexity. It's new types of patterns appearing at higher scales - patterns that don't exist at lower levels. Wetness emerges from H2O molecules. Life emerges from chemistry. Mind emerges from matter.
