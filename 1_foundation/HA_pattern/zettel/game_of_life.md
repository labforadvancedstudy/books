# Game of Life

## Core Insight
Simple rules creating infinite complexity - Conway's proof that computation and life can emerge from the barest ingredients.

Three rules:
1. A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
2. A live cell with 2-3 neighbors stays alive  
3. All other cells die

From these rules emerge: gliders that walk, guns that shoot, logic gates that compute, patterns that reproduce. Conway proved his game is Turing complete - it can compute anything computable. Life needs surprisingly little to bootstrap complexity.

The Game of Life whispers a cosmic secret: maybe our universe too is just simple rules playing out on a vast grid.
