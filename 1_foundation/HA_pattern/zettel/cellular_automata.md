# Cellular Automata

## Core Insight
Simple rules + local interactions = global complexity. The universe might be a vast cellular automaton computing itself.

Imagine a grid where each cell follows simple rules based on its neighbors. From this simplicity emerges stunning complexity: patterns that move, reproduce, compute. Conway's Game of Life proved that universe-like complexity needs only minimal ingredients.

Wolfram's Rule 30: one line, three neighbors, eight rules. Result? Apparent randomness that passes every statistical test. Maybe reality's complexity comes not from complex laws but simple rules iterated endlessly.
