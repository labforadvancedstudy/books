# Phase Transition

## Core Insight
The critical moment when quantity becomes quality - where gradual change suddenly transforms everything.

Heat water slowly: 99°C still liquid, 100°C suddenly steam. Cool slowly: 1°C still liquid, 0°C suddenly ice. The phase transition is nature's discontinuity - where patterns dramatically reorganize.

But the deep magic happens at critical points: where all scales become relevant, where fluctuations span the system, where the tiniest perturbation can cascade everywhere. Here, patterns are born and die.
