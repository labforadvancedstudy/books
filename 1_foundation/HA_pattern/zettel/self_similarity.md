# Self-Similarity

## Core Insight
The property of appearing the same at different scales - nature's way of encoding infinite detail in finite form.

Self-similarity is the fractal's defining magic: zoom in and find the whole repeated in the part. A coastline looks equally jagged at every magnification. A tree's smallest twig mirrors the entire tree's branching. This isn't coincidence but optimization - the same growth rules applied recursively.

Self-similarity compresses infinite complexity into simple rules. It's how nature packs maximum information into minimum instructions.
