# Tessellation

## Core Insight
Filling space without gaps or overlaps - the mathematical art of perfect fitting that reveals deep constraints on form.

Only three regular polygons tile the plane: triangles, squares, hexagons. This isn't arbitrary - it's forced by the geometry of flat space. Bees discovered hexagons maximize area while minimizing perimeter. Basalt columns crack into hexagons to release stress efficiently.

Tessellation is optimization made visible. Every tiling pattern represents a solution to competing constraints: fill space, minimize boundaries, maintain symmetry. The patterns we see are mathematics computing itself through physics.
