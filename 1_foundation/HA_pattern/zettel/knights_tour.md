# The Knight's Tour
## Core Insight
A chess knight visiting every square exactly once reveals the deep connection between games, graphs, and mathematical beauty - showing how constraints create elegant complexity.

## Content
Place a knight on a chessboard. Can it visit every square exactly once? This simple question has captivated mathematicians for over 1000 years.

The knight's L-shaped move (2+1 squares) creates a unique movement graph. Unlike rooks or bishops with their straight lines, the knight's path weaves an intricate dance across the board. This constraint - moving in crooked jumps - paradoxically enables something straight-movers cannot do: visiting every square exactly once.

**Open tours** end on a different square than they began. **Closed tours** return to the starting square, forming an endless cycle. The closed tour is rarer, more beautiful - a perfect loop through 64 squares.

The problem connects to:
- **Graph theory**: It's a Hamiltonian path problem
- **Algorithm design**: Backtracking, Warnsdorff's heuristic
- **Magic squares**: Numbered knight's tours create mathematical patterns
- **Art**: The path itself forms mesmerizing visual patterns

Euler studied it. So did countless others. The knight's tour shows how a simple rule (L-shaped moves) plus a simple goal (visit each square once) creates profound complexity.
