# Penrose Tiling

## Core Insight
Aperiodic order - patterns that never repeat yet follow strict rules, proving that order doesn't require repetition.

Penrose tiles shattered a millennia-old assumption: that order means periodicity. Using just two shapes (kites and darts, or thick and thin rhombi), Penrose created patterns that tile the infinite plane without ever repeating. Local rules create global non-repetition.

The profound implication: quasicrystals in nature follow these patterns. What mathematicians thought impossible, nature was already doing. The atoms in quasicrystals arrange in Penrose-like patterns - ordered but never repeating, like an infinite song that never loops.
