# Pattern Breaking

## Core Insight
The creative destruction of expectation - how innovation happens when patterns are deliberately violated to create new possibilities.

Every pattern creates expectation. Every expectation creates blindness. Pattern breaking is the art of seeing where others assume, questioning where others accept. Jazz breaks musical patterns. Picasso broke visual patterns. Einstein broke conceptual patterns.

But pattern breaking isn't random destruction. It's strategic violation - knowing the rules so well you know exactly how to break them meaningfully. The best pattern breakers are pattern masters who transcend their mastery.
