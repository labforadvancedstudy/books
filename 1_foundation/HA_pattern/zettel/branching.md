# Branching

## Core Insight
The pattern of distribution and collection - how nature solves the problem of connecting one to many or many to one.

Branching appears wherever flow needs optimization: rivers collecting water, trees distributing nutrients, lungs exchanging gases, neurons connecting thoughts. The pattern emerges from a simple principle: minimize transport cost while maximizing coverage.

Murray's law governs branching: the cube of the parent diameter equals the sum of the cubes of the children. This ratio minimizes energy loss. From capillaries to river deltas, the same mathematical relationship appears.
