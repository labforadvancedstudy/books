# Wave

## Core Insight
The pattern of propagation - how disturbances travel through space and time, carrying information without carrying matter.

Waves are pattern in motion. A wave in water moves forward but the water molecules just bob up and down. The pattern travels; the medium stays. This separation of pattern from substrate is profound - it's how information moves through the universe.

Everything waves: light, sound, matter (quantum waves), gravity, even traffic jams. Waves interfere, creating new patterns from old. They reflect, refract, diffract - revealing the hidden geometry of their medium.
