# Repetition

## Core Insight
The universe's fundamental tendency to repeat successful forms - the simplest pattern that creates all other patterns.

Before there was consciousness to recognize patterns, there was repetition. A wave repeats its form. An orbit traces the same path. A crystal grows by repeating its unit cell. Repetition is pattern in its most primitive, powerful form.

Why does the universe repeat? Because what works, works. The stable configurations persist while unstable ones vanish. Reality is the accumulation of successful repetitions.
