# Falling Energy

## Core Insight
Height is energy waiting to happen - gravity's promise of future motion.

Lift a rock, you've given it potential. Release it, and that potential becomes kinetic, then sound and heat on impact. A child on a slide knows this: climb up (work against gravity), slide down (gravity does work on you), feel the speed.

The beautiful thing about gravitational potential energy is its patience. That rock will wait forever at height, holding its energy until released. Dams exploit this patience, holding water high until we need electricity.

Every waterfall is a gravitational energy converter. Every bouncing ball is trading kinetic for potential and back. Every planet orbiting is caught in an eternal exchange between these two forms.
