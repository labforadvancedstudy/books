# Cold

## Core Insight
The absence of heat energy - nature's default state revealed through sensation.

Cold isn't a thing - it's the lack of a thing. When you touch ice, heat energy flows FROM your hand TO the ice, making your hand feel cold. Children discover this backwards: they think cold "enters" their hand. The truth is stranger: their warmth is leaving.

Before thermometers, before atomic theory, humans knew cold through experience: winter's bite, ice's sting, the shiver of wet skin in wind. We invented clothing, shelter, and fire not to "keep cold out" but to keep heat in - though we didn't know this for millennia.

The universe's default state is cold. Absolute cold. Stars and fires are rare rebellions against this cosmic iciness.
