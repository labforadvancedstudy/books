# Heat Death

## Core Insight
The universe's ultimate fate - when all energy spreads evenly and nothing can happen.

Heat death is entropy's final victory. Given infinite time, all energy gradients disappear. Stars burn out, black holes evaporate, particles decay. The universe reaches maximum entropy - uniform temperature everywhere, no flows possible, no work extractable.

This isn't death by freezing but by equilibrium. Energy still exists but in its most degraded form - uniform low-temperature radiation. No gradients means no possibility of change. Time becomes meaningless when nothing can happen.

Current estimate: 10^100 years. The universe will spend most of its existence in this state - a cold, dark, eventless expanse. We live in the brief energetic era when gradients exist and interesting things can happen. Carpe diem on a cosmic scale.
