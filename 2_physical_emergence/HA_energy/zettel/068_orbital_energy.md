# Orbital Energy

## Core Insight
Perpetual falling that misses the ground - kinetic and potential in perfect balance.

Orbits are energy's most elegant dance. An orbiting body has negative total energy (bound), perfectly balanced between positive kinetic (motion) and negative potential (position). Go faster and you rise to higher orbit. Go slower and you fall to lower orbit.

The magic: orbital velocity decreases with altitude. Higher satellites move slower but have more total energy. This seems paradoxical until you realize potential energy dominates. Raising an orbit requires adding energy, which counterintuitively slows you down.

Circular orbits live at the sweet spot where centripetal acceleration equals gravitational acceleration. Elliptical orbits trade kinetic for potential and back each orbit. All bound orbits have E < 0. Reach E = 0 and you've achieved escape.
