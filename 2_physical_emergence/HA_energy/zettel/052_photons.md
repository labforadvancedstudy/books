# Photons

## Core Insight
Energy packets flying at the cosmic speed limit - the universe's fundamental energy messengers.

Photons are pure energy made particle. No mass, no charge, just energy and momentum wrapped in electromagnetic fields. They're born when charges accelerate, travel at light speed always, and die by giving their energy to other charges.

Each photon carries energy E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. This quantization solved physics' ultraviolet catastrophe: energy comes in discrete packets, not continuous waves. A red photon literally carries less energy than a blue one.

Photons mediate all electromagnetic interactions. The force between charges? Photon exchange. Light from stars? Photons. Radio, heat radiation, X-rays? All photons, differing only in energy. They're how energy moves when matter doesn't.
