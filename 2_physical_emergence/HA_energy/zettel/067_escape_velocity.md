# Escape Velocity

## Core Insight
The speed to achieve infinite separation - gravity's exit fee paid in kinetic energy.

Escape velocity is the universe's price for freedom from gravity. Earth demands 11.2 km/s. The sun demands 617 km/s from Earth's orbit. A black hole demands more than light can pay. It's the kinetic energy needed to climb gravity's potential well to infinity.

The beautiful part: it's independent of mass. A pebble and a rocket need the same speed (ignoring air resistance). The formula v = √(2GM/r) contains no projectile mass - only the escaping body's will to leave and the parent body's gravitational grip.

This isn't about getting to space - that's easy. It's about never falling back. Reach escape velocity and you're unbound, free to coast to infinity. Fall short by even 1 m/s and you'll return eventually, enslaved by the inverse square law.
