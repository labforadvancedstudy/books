# Enzymatic Catalysis

## Core Insight
Protein machines lowering energy barriers - life's lock-picks for chemical reactions.

Enzymes are molecular sculptors that reshape energy landscapes. A reaction might require 30 kcal/mol to proceed uncatalyzed. An enzyme grabs the reactants, twists them into almost-product shapes, reducing the barrier to 10 kcal/mol. Same starting point, same ending point, easier path.

They achieve this through exquisite specificity. Each enzyme's active site is shaped to stabilize the transition state - the awkward molecular configuration between reactant and product. By making the hardest part easier, they accelerate reactions by factors of millions.

Without enzymes, life-essential reactions would take centuries. With them, milliseconds. They don't change thermodynamics (start and end energies), just kinetics (how fast). They're nature's way of making the possible practical.
