# Plasma State

## Core Insight
Matter so energetic that electrons abandon their atoms - the universe's favorite phase of matter.

Add enough energy to gas and electrons rip free from nuclei. This isn't just hot gas - it's a fundamentally different state where charged particles roam free. Plasma conducts electricity, responds to magnetic fields, and glows with the light of electronic transitions.

Stars are plasma. Lightning channels are plasma. The solar wind is plasma. By mass, 99% of visible matter in the universe is plasma. Solid, liquid, and gas are the exceptional states - plasma is the norm. We just live in a cold corner where atoms stay intact.

The energy threshold for plasma depends on the gas. But once reached, matter behaves collectively. Individual atoms cease to matter; bulk electromagnetic properties dominate. It's matter's way of handling too much energy - break apart and dance.
