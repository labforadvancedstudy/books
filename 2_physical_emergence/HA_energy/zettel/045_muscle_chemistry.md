# Muscle Chemistry

## Core Insight
ATP powering molecular motors - chemistry becoming mechanical work at the nanoscale.

Muscles are chemistry engines. Each contraction is millions of myosin heads grabbing actin filaments, pulling, releasing, and resetting. The power stroke comes from ATP hydrolysis - breaking one phosphate bond releases energy that changes myosin's shape, creating mechanical force.

The scale is staggering. A single muscle fiber contains thousands of myofibrils, each with millions of motor proteins. When you lift a weight, trillions of molecular motors fire in coordination, each burning one ATP per power stroke. Chemistry becomes motion through sheer numbers.

Efficiency varies: 25% in ideal conditions, less when cold or fatigued. The waste heat isn't waste - it maintains body temperature. We're warm-blooded because our motors run hot.
