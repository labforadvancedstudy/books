# Vacuum Energy

## Core Insight
Empty space seething with quantum fluctuations - the universe's irreducible energy floor.

The vacuum isn't empty. Quantum mechanics forbids true nothingness. The uncertainty principle demands that even "empty" space teems with virtual particle pairs, popping into existence and annihilating in times too brief to measure. This zero-point energy permeates all space.

The energy density is controversial - naive calculations give infinite energy, renormalization gives zero, cosmological observations suggest 10^-9 J/m³. Whatever the value, it's there. The Casimir effect proves it: parallel plates in vacuum attract because they exclude some vacuum fluctuations between them.

This might be dark energy - the mysterious force accelerating cosmic expansion. If so, empty space itself carries energy that gravitationally repels. The emptier the universe gets, the faster it expands. A runaway vacuum.
