# Conservation Laws

## Core Insight
What cannot be created or destroyed - the universe's unbreakable accounting rules.

Conservation laws are nature's bookkeeping. Energy, momentum, angular momentum, charge - these quantities can transform, transfer, and hide, but their totals never change in isolated systems. The universe runs a perfectly balanced ledger.

These aren't arbitrary rules we discovered. Noether proved they arise from symmetries:
- Time symmetry → energy conservation
- Space symmetry → momentum conservation  
- Rotational symmetry → angular momentum conservation
- Gauge symmetry → charge conservation

Every conservation law reflects an underlying symmetry of spacetime or quantum fields. The universe conserves what it must to remain consistent with its own geometry. Breaking a conservation law would mean breaking spacetime itself.
