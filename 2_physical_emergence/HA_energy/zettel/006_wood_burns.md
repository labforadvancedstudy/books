# Wood Burns

## Core Insight
Ancient sunlight released in minutes - trees are time-delayed solar batteries.

When wood burns, you're witnessing a beautiful circular story. Years ago, leaves captured sunlight, converted it to chemical bonds, built cellulose and lignin. The tree was a slow-motion recording device, storing solar energy in molecular structures.

Fire reverses this process violently. What took years to store releases in minutes. The carbon that pulled CO₂ from ancient air now returns it. The hydrogen that was once water vapor becomes water vapor again. The energy that was patient becomes urgent.

A burning log is thus a kind of time machine - past sunlight illuminating present darkness.
