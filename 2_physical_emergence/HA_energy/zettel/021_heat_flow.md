# Heat Flow

## Core Insight
Energy's inevitable journey from concentrated to dispersed - the universe's one-way street.

Heat never flows uphill. This simple observation contains one of physics' deepest truths. Hot coffee cools, ice melts, but you'll never see lukewarm coffee spontaneously separate into hot coffee and ice cubes. Energy disperses; it doesn't concentrate itself.

This isn't a law we made up - it's what we observe happening literally everywhere, always, without exception. Stars pour heat into cold space. Engines waste heat to the environment. Life temporarily concentrates energy but ultimately increases universal disorder.

The direction of heat flow defines time's arrow. If you see a video of heat flowing from cold to hot without external work, you know it's playing backwards. Heat flow is how the universe tells time.
