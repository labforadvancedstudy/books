# Friction Heat

## Core Insight
Ordered motion becoming chaotic thermal energy - nature's tax on movement.

Rub your hands together. They warm up. You've converted organized motion (hands moving back and forth) into disorganized motion (molecules jiggling faster). Friction is nature's way of taking ordered kinetic energy and scrambling it into heat.

This is irreversible. You can't rub cold hands together and make them move apart. The entropy ratchet only turns one way. Every sliding, rolling, or rubbing interaction pays this thermal tax. Even supposedly "frictionless" systems just hide the friction elsewhere.

Cars dedicate radiators to dumping friction's heat. Meteors glow from atmospheric friction. Your joints need lubrication to minimize this energy loss. Friction is why perpetual motion machines fail - there's always some surface, some interaction, converting motion to heat.
