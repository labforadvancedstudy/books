# ATP Currency

## Core Insight
Life's universal energy token - the dollar bill of cellular economics.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is life's chosen currency. Like money standardizes value exchange in economies, ATP standardizes energy exchange in cells. Need to move? Spend ATP. Think? ATP. Grow? ATP. Every cellular process accepts this molecular payment.

The genius is in the phosphate bonds. ATP carries three phosphates, like a molecular spring wound tight. Pop off one phosphate to make ADP, and 7.3 kcal/mol releases - just enough energy for most cellular tasks without excess waste. It's the Goldilocks energy packet.

Your body cycles through its own weight in ATP daily. You don't store it - you constantly recycle it. Mitochondria are the mints, continuously converting ADP back to ATP using energy from food. Life is an ATP recycling program that happens to build organisms.
