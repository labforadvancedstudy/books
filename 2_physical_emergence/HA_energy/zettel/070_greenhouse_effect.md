# Greenhouse Effect

## Core Insight
Atmospheric energy trap - transparent to sunlight, opaque to Earth's infrared.

The greenhouse effect is wavelength discrimination. Sunlight (mostly visible) passes through atmosphere easily. Earth re-radiates this energy as infrared (lower temperature = longer wavelength). But CO₂, water vapor, and methane absorb infrared, trapping energy.

It's like a one-way mirror for energy. Short wavelengths enter, long wavelengths can't leave. The atmosphere acts as partial insulation, keeping Earth 33°C warmer than it would be otherwise. Without it, Earth would average -18°C.

The delicate balance: too little greenhouse effect and Earth freezes (Mars). Too much and Earth overheats (Venus). We're tweaking this balance by adding CO₂, trapping more outgoing infrared. The physics is simple; the consequences are complex.
