# Noether's Theorem

## Core Insight
Every symmetry creates a conservation law - the universe's deepest connection between geometry and physics.

Emmy Noether discovered something profound: whenever physics looks the same under some transformation, something must be conserved. Shift time? Energy is conserved. Shift position? Momentum is conserved. Rotate? Angular momentum is conserved.

This isn't coincidence - it's mathematical necessity. Symmetries in the action integral directly generate conserved quantities. The math is complex but the result is simple: the shape of spacetime determines what must be preserved.

This theorem unified disparate conservation laws into a single principle. It also predicts: find a new symmetry, get a new conservation law free. It's why physicists obsess over symmetries - they're the universe's source code for conservation.
