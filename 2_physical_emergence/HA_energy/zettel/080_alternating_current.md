# Alternating Current

## Core Insight
Electrons dancing back and forth - the counterintuitive way we deliver power globally.

AC power is electrons doing the wave - oscillating in place rather than flowing. In US outlets, electrons reverse direction 120 times per second (60 Hz). They barely move net distance, yet power flows at nearly light speed. It's the wave pattern that travels, not the electrons.

Why this dance? Transformers only work with changing magnetic fields. AC naturally provides this change, allowing easy voltage conversion. Step up for efficient long-distance transmission, step down for safe home use. DC can't do this simply.

The War of Currents (Edison's DC vs Tesla's AC) was won by physics: AC's transformability trumped DC's conceptual simplicity. Now the entire grid runs on synchronized oscillations, billions of electrons dancing in perfect phase across continents.
