# Movement Energy

## Core Insight
Motion itself is energy - the universe's most obvious secret hiding in plain sight.

A child throwing a ball knows intuitively: the harder you throw, the faster it goes, the more it hurts to catch. They've discovered kinetic energy without the formula. Movement carries something invisible that can be transferred by collision.

Watch billiard balls: the cue ball stops, the struck ball rolls. The movement jumped from one to the other. Energy without matter crossing between objects. This isn't intuitive - it took Newton to formalize what every child experiences.

The profound truth: anything moving has energy simply by virtue of its motion. A galaxy hurtling through space, a bullet, a snail - all carry kinetic energy proportional to their mass and velocity squared. That squared is why fast things are so dangerous.
