# Dissipation

## Core Insight
Useful energy becoming useless heat - the universe's tax on every energy transaction.

Dissipation is energy's inevitable degradation. Organized energy (electricity, motion, chemical) becomes disorganized heat. This isn't loss - energy is conserved. It's loss of usefulness. Heat at environmental temperature can't do work.

Every real process dissipates. Friction turns motion to heat. Resistance turns current to heat. Viscosity turns flow to heat. Even thinking dissipates - your brain radiates 20 watts of heat from organizing information.

This is why perpetual motion fails and why efficiency never reaches 100%. Some energy always leaks into thermal motion of surroundings. The universe charges this fee on every transaction, slowly converting all organized energy into universal warmth.
