# Sunlight

## Core Insight
Nuclear fusion's energy crossing 93 million miles of vacuum - the ultimate wireless power transfer.

A child feels sunlight on their face and smiles. They're experiencing the end result of hydrogen atoms fusing 8 minutes ago in the sun's core. That warmth traveled through the vacuum of space as electromagnetic waves, needing no medium, carrying energy without mass.

Sunlight powers almost everything: it drives weather, grows plants, evaporates oceans, creates wind. Even fossil fuels are just ancient sunlight in storage. When we burn coal, we're releasing Carboniferous sunlight. Only nuclear, geothermal, and tidal energy escape the sun's influence.

The shocking thing about sunlight is its constancy. For billions of years, it has delivered roughly the same energy to Earth. Life evolved assuming this stability. Civilization depends on it.
