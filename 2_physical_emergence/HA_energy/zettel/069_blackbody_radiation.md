# Blackbody Radiation

## Core Insight
Temperature made visible - all objects glow with their thermal signature.

Everything above absolute zero emits electromagnetic radiation. The spectrum depends only on temperature, not material. Hot coals glow red (700°C), molten steel glows white (1500°C), the sun glows across visible spectrum (5800°C). Temperature determines color.

This universality puzzled physicists. Why should all materials emit identically? Planck's answer birthed quantum mechanics: energy comes in discrete packets (E = hf). This quantization prevents the "ultraviolet catastrophe" classical physics predicted.

You're glowing right now - peaking at 10 micron infrared. Stars announce their temperature through color. The cosmic microwave background glows at 2.7K, the universe's current temperature. Blackbody radiation is temperature's honest autobiography.
