# Relativistic Kinetic

## Core Insight
At high speeds, kinetic energy approaches infinity - the universe's speed limit enforcer.

Newton's KE = ½mv² works until you go really fast. Then Einstein's version takes over: KE = (γ-1)mc², where γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²). As velocity approaches light speed, γ approaches infinity, making kinetic energy infinite.

This isn't just mathematical oddity. Particle accelerators slam into this wall daily. Each percent closer to light speed costs exponentially more energy. The Large Hadron Collider pumps protons to 99.9999991% of c, giving each proton the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito.

The universe enforces its speed limit through energy requirements. You can get arbitrarily close to c by adding energy, but never reach it. Mass becomes an anchor that gets heavier with speed. Only massless particles travel at c because they have no anchor to grow heavy.
