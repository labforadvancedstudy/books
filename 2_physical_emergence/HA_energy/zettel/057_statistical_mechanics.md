# Statistical Mechanics

## Core Insight
Macroscopic properties emerge from microscopic chaos - probability becomes certainty at scale.

Statistical mechanics bridges the quantum world of atoms with the classical world we experience. Individual particles behave randomly, but 10²³ random particles show predictable collective behavior. Chaos averages into order through sheer numbers.

Temperature, pressure, heat capacity - none exist for individual particles. They emerge from statistical distributions. The magic: we can derive macroscopic laws from microscopic randomness. The ideal gas law falls out naturally from counting molecular states.

This revealed a profound truth: many properties we consider fundamental are actually statistical. They exist only for ensembles, emerging from probability distributions. The universe runs on statistics, and certainty is just overwhelmingly probable uncertainty.
