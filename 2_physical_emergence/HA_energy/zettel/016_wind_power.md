# Wind Power

## Core Insight
Solar energy disguised as moving air - the atmosphere's kinetic battery.

Wind is sunlight in translation. Uneven heating creates pressure differences, pressure differences create flow, flow carries kinetic energy. When wind pushes a sail or spins a turbine, it's transferring momentum accumulated over thousands of miles.

Children flying kites feel this energy through the string - the tug, the lift, the occasional violent yank. They're tethered to atmospheric power. Ancient humans learned to steal this energy with sails and windmills, converting air's motion to ship's motion or millstone's grinding.

Modern wind turbines are energy thieves on an industrial scale, robbing moving air of its kinetic energy and converting it to electricity. The wind doesn't mind - there's always more where that came from, as long as the sun shines unevenly on Earth.
