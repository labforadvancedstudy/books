# Kinetic Energy

## Core Insight
Energy equals half mass times velocity squared - why speed kills.

The formula KE = ½mv² contains a violent truth: double the speed, quadruple the energy. This is why a bullet is deadly but a thrown rock isn't - same mass, vastly different velocity. The squared term makes speed the dominant factor.

Children learn this through experience. A ball thrown gently bounces off. Thrown hard, it hurts. But they don't realize the mathematical brutality: 2x speed = 4x energy, 3x speed = 9x energy. Highway crashes aren't twice as bad as city crashes; they're four times worse.

That mysterious ½ comes from calculus - integrating force over distance as you accelerate mass from rest. But the v² is fundamental: energy scales with the square of speed in our universe. This isn't negotiable.
