# Metabolism

## Core Insight
Life's controlled combustion - burning food slowly enough to harness the energy.

Metabolism is fire tamed to molecular precision. While a log burns chaotically, cells burn glucose through dozens of controlled steps, capturing energy in chemical bonds rather than losing it all as heat. It's the difference between explosion and engine.

Your body is performing millions of tiny controlled burns right now. Each cell is a microscopic furnace, oxidizing fuel molecules, capturing the energy in ATP bonds, using that energy to maintain order against entropy's pull. You are powered by a democracy of tiny fires.

The miracle of metabolism is its efficiency and control. A car engine wastes 75% of fuel energy as heat. Your muscles convert 25% of food energy to mechanical work - similar efficiency but at body temperature instead of hundreds of degrees.
