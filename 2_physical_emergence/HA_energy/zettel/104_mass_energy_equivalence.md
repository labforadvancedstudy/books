# Mass-Energy Equivalence

## Core Insight
E=mc² - mass is frozen energy, energy has weight.

Einstein's most famous equation reveals mass and energy are the same thing in different forms. Mass is just energy so concentrated it appears stationary. A proton's mass is mostly binding energy holding quarks together. An electron's mass is all intrinsic - pure frozen energy.

The c² factor is enormous: 9×10^16 m²/s². One gram of matter equals 90 trillion joules - enough to power a city for days. This explains nuclear weapons' power and why stars shine for billions of years. Converting even tiny amounts of mass releases enormous energy.

The equation works both ways. Accelerators create massive particles from pure kinetic energy. The early universe was so hot that energy spontaneously condensed into particle-antiparticle pairs. Mass isn't stuff - it's energy behaving differently.
