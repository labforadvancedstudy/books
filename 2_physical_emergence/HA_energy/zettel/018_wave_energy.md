# Wave Energy

## Core Insight
Pattern propagation carrying energy without transporting matter - the universe's favorite delivery system.

Throw a stone in a pond. The ripples carry energy outward, but the water molecules just bob up and down. They don't travel with the wave. This is the wave paradox: energy moves horizontally while matter moves vertically.

Ocean waves can travel thousands of miles, carrying storm energy across entire oceans. Surfers ride this transmitted energy, borrowed from distant winds. Tsunamis demonstrate wave energy's devastating potential - the entire ocean depth participating in energy transport.

Waves are how the universe prefers to move energy: water waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, even probability waves in quantum mechanics. Matter stays local; patterns go global.
