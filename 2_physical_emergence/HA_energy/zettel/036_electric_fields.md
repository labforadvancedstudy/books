# Electric Fields

## Core Insight
Invisible force tentacles extending from every charge - space itself modified by electrical presence.

Electric fields are how charges "feel" each other across empty space. Every charged particle warps the space around it, creating an invisible field that pushes or pulls other charges. No physical connection needed - the field IS the connection.

Place a positive charge in space, and it creates a field pointing outward. Another positive charge feels a push along these field lines. A negative charge feels a pull. The field exists even with no other charges present - it's a modification of space itself, waiting to exert force.

This was revolutionary: force without contact. Before fields, physics required touching. Fields showed that empty space could carry influence. This idea would later inspire Einstein - if electric fields can warp space, why not mass and gravity?
