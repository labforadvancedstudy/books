# Mechanical Work

## Core Insight
Force times distance equals energy transferred - the universe's exchange rate.

Work is energy in transition. When you push a box across the floor, you're not creating energy - you're transferring it from your muscles (chemical) to the box (kinetic) and floor (heat). Work is the accountant's ledger entry recording this transfer.

The profound insight: work connects force to energy. Force alone doesn't cost energy (holding a weight stationary), distance alone doesn't transfer energy (coasting in space). But force through distance always means energy has moved from one form to another.

This is why machines help: they trade force for distance. A lever lets you apply small force over large distance to create large force over small distance. The work (energy) remains the same, but the force-distance tradeoff changes. No machine creates energy; they just reshape how we apply it.
