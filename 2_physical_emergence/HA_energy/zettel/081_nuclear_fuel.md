# Nuclear Fuel

## Core Insight
Matter's deepest energy reserves - unlocking forces that bind nuclei.

Nuclear fuel makes chemical fuel look like a child's toy. Uranium-235 releases 2 million times more energy per gram than coal. This isn't chemistry (electron rearrangement) but nuclear physics (nucleon rearrangement). We're tapping energy scales that normally only stars access.

The process: neutron hits U-235 nucleus, splitting it into fragments plus 2-3 neutrons plus 200 MeV of energy. Those neutrons split more nuclei - chain reaction. Each fission converts 0.1% of matter to energy via E=mc². Tiny percentage, enormous result.

One pellet of enriched uranium (pencil eraser sized) equals one ton of coal. This energy density enables submarines to operate for decades without refueling and France to generate 70% of its electricity from a handful of plants.
