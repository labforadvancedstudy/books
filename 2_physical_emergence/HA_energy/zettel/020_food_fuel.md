# Food Fuel

## Core Insight
Edible energy in molecular packaging - sunshine processed for animal consumption.

When you eat, you're consuming portable power plants. Every calorie is stored sunlight, processed by plants, sometimes reprocessed by animals. Food is the most intimate energy transfer - you literally break it down and rebuild it into yourself.

A child learns hunger is the body's fuel gauge. Eating brings energy: the ability to run, play, think. They discover different foods provide different energy: sugar for quick bursts, bread for sustained effort, fat for long-term storage.

The numbers are staggering: a human needs about 2000 kcal daily - roughly the energy to keep a 100-watt bulb lit constantly. Your body is a biological power plant, burning glucose and fat as surely as a car burns gasoline, just more elegantly.
