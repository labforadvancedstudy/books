# Quantum Field Theory

## Core Insight
Particles are excitations in underlying fields - energy manifesting as ripples in spacetime's fabric.

QFT reveals particles aren't things but events. The electron field permeates all space; electrons are localized excitations in this field. Photons are ripples in the electromagnetic field. Even mass emerges from interactions with the Higgs field.

Energy creates particles. With enough energy, you can excite any field to create its corresponding particle. E=mc² isn't just about converting mass to energy - it's about energy creating mass from quantum fields. Particle accelerators are field exciters.

Virtual particles constantly bubble from vacuum energy, existing briefly within uncertainty principle limits. They mediate forces - electromagnetic force is virtual photon exchange, strong force is gluon exchange. Forces ARE energy exchanges at the quantum level.
