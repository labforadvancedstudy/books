# Height Energy

## Core Insight
Elevation stores work - the universe's simplest battery.

A book on a shelf has energy it didn't have on the floor. This seems absurd - it's just sitting there! But the work you did lifting it against gravity is stored in its position. The book remembers being lifted.

Children discover this on swings: pump your legs, go higher, feel the pause at the peak, then the rush of descent. They're converting muscle energy to height energy to motion energy to height again. A pendulum of transformation.

This positional energy scales linearly with height but depends on what you're measuring from. Sea level? The floor? Earth's center? The universe has no absolute height, only differences. Energy comes from the change.
