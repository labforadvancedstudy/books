# Lightning Power

## Core Insight
Nature's violent reminder that energy can leap through air - the sky's own particle accelerator.

Lightning is energy made theatrical. Billions of electrons, separated by updrafts and downdrafts, build impossible voltages until air itself breaks down, becomes plasma, and conducts. The flash you see is air heated to 30,000°C - five times hotter than the sun's surface.

Ancient humans saw gods throwing bolts. They weren't entirely wrong - lightning is what happens when the universe can't maintain an energy imbalance. The potential difference becomes so extreme that the very atoms of air are ripped apart to allow current flow.

A single bolt carries the energy of about 250 kWh - enough to power a home for a week. Released in microseconds. This concentration of power in time is what makes lightning so destructive and magnificent.
