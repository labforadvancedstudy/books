# Carbon Sequestration

## Core Insight
Reversing combustion's exhaust - putting the CO₂ genie back in its bottle.

Carbon sequestration attempts to undo what fossil fuel burning did: remove CO₂ from atmosphere and store it securely. Nature does this via photosynthesis and ocean absorption, but too slowly for our emissions rate. We're trying to accelerate it.

Methods vary:
- Biological: planting forests, enhancing soil carbon
- Geological: injecting CO₂ into deep rock formations  
- Chemical: converting CO₂ to stable minerals
- Direct air capture: machines scrubbing atmosphere

The energy irony: capturing and compressing CO₂ requires energy, often 25-30% of the power plant's output. We burn more fuel to capture the emissions from burning fuel. Only renewable-powered capture truly removes carbon.
