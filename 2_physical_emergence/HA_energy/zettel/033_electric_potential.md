# Electric Potential

## Core Insight
Voltage is electrical height - energy per unit charge waiting to flow downhill.

Just as masses have gravitational potential energy from height, charges have electrical potential energy from voltage. A 9-volt battery maintains an electrical "hill" - positive charges want to roll down it just like balls want to roll down physical hills.

Voltage doesn't flow; it's the pressure that causes current to flow. Like water pressure in pipes, electrical potential creates the urge for charges to move. Connect a circuit, and charges surf down the voltage gradient, delivering energy along the way.

The beautiful parallel: lifting mass stores gravitational energy, separating charges stores electrical energy. Batteries and capacitors are charge separators, creating electrical hills that electrons eagerly tumble down when given a path.
