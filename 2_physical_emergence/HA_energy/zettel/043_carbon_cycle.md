# Carbon Cycle

## Core Insight
Carbon atoms riding the energy elevator between CO₂ and organic molecules - Earth's energy circulation system.

Carbon is energy's favorite hitchhiker. In CO₂, it's at ground floor - low energy, stable, boring. Photosynthesis hauls it up to sugars and organic molecules, storing solar energy in the elevation. Respiration and combustion drop it back down, releasing that stored energy.

Every carbon atom in your body has made this journey countless times. From atmospheric CO₂ to plant sugar to animal flesh to bacterial food to CO₂ again. Each cycle carries energy from sun to life to heat to space.

The genius of the carbon cycle: it never loses carbon (mostly), just endlessly transforms it between energy states. Fossil fuels are carbon that got stuck in the up elevator millions of years ago. Burning them completes ancient cycles.
