# Field Energy

## Core Insight
Empty space holding energy - the vacuum's secret bank account.

Fields store energy in nothingness. An electric field between capacitor plates contains energy proportional to field strength squared. A magnetic field in an inductor holds energy. Even "empty" space between charges or magnets seethes with field energy.

This shattered the notion that energy needs matter. Fields ARE energy, spread through space. The energy density equals ε₀E²/2 for electric fields, B²/2μ₀ for magnetic fields. Space itself becomes the storage medium.

When you charge a capacitor, where does the energy go? Not in the plates - in the field between them. When you magnetize an inductor, energy fills the surrounding space. Fields are nature's way of storing energy in the very fabric of spacetime.
