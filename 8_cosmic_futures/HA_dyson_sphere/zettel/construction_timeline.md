# Construction Timeline

## Core Insight
Building a Dyson sphere isn't a project - it's an evolutionary process that transforms the builders more than the star.

Generation 1 (decades): Individual solar power satellites. Each one a triumph. Engineers celebrate every successful deployment. The sun is barely dimmed by 0.00001%.

Generation 10 (centuries): Automated factories churn out collectors. What was celebration becomes routine. Children grow up seeing new satellites deployed daily. The sun dims by 0.1%. Earth notices cooler summers.

Generation 100 (millennia): The swarm is self-building. Von Neumann assemblers convert asteroids to collectors without human oversight. Humans don't build anymore - they manage rates of expansion. The sun is 10% dimmed. The solar system's appearance from outside has changed.

Generation 1000 (deep time): Humans are unrecognizable. The project that began for energy has become identity. Builder-cultures speak in orbital mechanics. The sun is 90% enclosed. Completion isn't a goal anymore - it's a thermodynamic inevitability.
