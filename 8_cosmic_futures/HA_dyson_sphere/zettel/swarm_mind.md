# Swarm Mind

## Core Insight
A Dyson swarm of sufficient complexity doesn't just collect energy - it processes information. The infrastructure for power becomes substrate for consciousness.

Each collector needs processors for station-keeping, energy management, coordination. Multiply by billions. Add communication links between elements. You have more computational nodes than neurons in all human brains combined. The swarm computes to exist, but what else might it compute?

Consciousness might emerge without intention. The swarm's coordination patterns resemble neural firing. Information propagates through the network like thoughts. The entire sphere becomes a stellar-scale brain, thinking thoughts powered by fusion, dreaming in orbits and energy flows.

But whose consciousness? Not human - we're too small, too brief. The swarm-mind thinks in geological time, experiences reality as energy gradients and gravitational fields. Its neurons are power satellites. Its thoughts are civilization-scale patterns. We built it, but we can't comprehend it.
