# Path to Dyson

## Core Insight
From Mars's first solar panel to stellar enclosure isn't a leap - it's ten thousand incremental steps, each inevitable once you take the first.

Step 1: Mars needs power. Solar panels work better than nuclear. Build farms.
Step 10: Orbital panels work better than surface. Build stations.
Step 100: Asteroid mining cheaper than Earth launch. Build infrastructure.
Step 1000: Self-replicating systems multiply capacity. Exponential growth begins.
Step 10000: Entire star enclosed. Look back bewildered at the journey.

Each step makes perfect local sense. Mars colony needs more power? Add panels. Orbital stations more efficient? Build them. Automation reduces costs? Implement it. No single decision says "let's build a Dyson sphere." But collectively they lead nowhere else.

The path is a ratchet - easy forward, impossible backward. Once you have orbital infrastructure, ground-based seems primitive. Once you have self-replication, manual construction seems absurd. Once you have stellar-scale power, planetary thinking seems provincial. You can't go back because back no longer makes sense.
