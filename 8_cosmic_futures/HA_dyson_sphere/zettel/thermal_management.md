# Thermal Management

## Core Insight
In space, heat is the silent killer. Without air to convect or ground to conduct, every joule absorbed must be radiated or you cook in your own efficiency.

Solar collectors face the sun's fury - megawatts per square meter at close orbits. Even 99% efficient conversion leaves kilowatts of waste heat per panel. In atmosphere, that's warm. In vacuum, that's death. Components melt. Electronics fail. The perfect solar panel becomes expensive slag.

The solution is elegant: make waste heat work. Radiator panels on the dark side, running thermal gradients for power. Heat pipes moving energy from hot to cold faces. The entire collector becomes a heat engine, extracting extra power from temperature differences. Waste becomes resource.

But the sphere itself? Trillions of collectors radiating infrared create a heat bubble around the star. Inner collectors run hotter. The sphere develops thermal structure - hot equator, cool poles, convection cells of radiation. We don't just build a power collector. We build new stellar weather.
