# Transcendence Trap

## Core Insight
The Dyson sphere promises transcendence but delivers a different prison - perfect optimization becomes perfect stasis.

The logic seems flawless: capture all energy, compute all possibilities, solve all problems, become gods. Each step follows inevitably. More power enables deeper simulation. Deeper simulation approaches perfect prediction. Perfect prediction enables optimal action. Optimal action maximizes utility. Maximum utility is godhood.

But the sphere-builders discover a paradox. Perfect optimization eliminates choice. When you can compute the best action, all others become irrational. When every decision has a thermodynamically correct answer, free will becomes inefficiency. The builders achieve omnipotence and lose agency.

The most advanced sphere-civilizations stop deciding. They compute. Their actions follow from calculations as inevitably as orbits follow from gravity. They know everything, control everything, and experience nothing. They've built a cage of pure reason, escaped the universe only to be trapped by logic itself.
