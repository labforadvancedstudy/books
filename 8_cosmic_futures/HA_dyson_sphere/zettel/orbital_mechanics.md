# Orbital Mechanics

## Core Insight
In space, everything falls forever. Master this truth and you master the architecture of Dyson spheres.

Every collector is in free fall toward the sun, missing constantly. The dance of gravity and velocity creates stability from motion. Too fast and you escape. Too slow and you burn. The sweet spot - where centripetal force exactly balances gravity - that's where you build.

But millions of collectors create millions of gravitational interactions. Each tugs on neighbors, creating perturbations that compound over time. The three-body problem becomes the billion-body nightmare. Without constant adjustment, orbits decay into chaos. The sphere dies in a cascade of collisions.

So we teach collectors to think. Each one calculates its neighbors' positions, predicts perturbations, adjusts with ion thrusters. The swarm becomes a self-organizing system, maintaining formation through distributed intelligence. Orbital mechanics transforms from physics to philosophy - how do billion independent agents coordinate without central control?
