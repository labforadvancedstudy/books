# Invisible Civilization

## Core Insight
A completed Dyson sphere makes its builders invisible to the universe - the ultimate cosmic introversion.

From outside, a sphere-wrapped star simply vanishes. Visible light: blocked. Radio emissions: absorbed. The only signature is waste heat in deep infrared - the whisper of a civilization trying not to be heard. Where once a star blazed, now only darkness with the temperature of lukewarm coffee.

This changes everything about contact. Pre-sphere civilizations broadcast their existence through stellar light. Post-sphere ones hide inside self-made wombs. The galaxy might be full of Dyson spheres we can't see because that's the point - they're cosmic cocoons for civilizations that have turned inward.

The builders face a choice: remain detectable and vulnerable, or vanish into engineered darkness. Most choose darkness. Not from fear but from focus - when you have everything you need inside, why leak energy advertising your existence?
