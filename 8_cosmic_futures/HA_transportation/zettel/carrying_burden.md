# Carrying and Burden

## Core Insight
The first multiplication of human capability - when we learned to transport more than our bodies, we began transporting our futures.

A mother carrying her child. A hunter hauling prey back to camp. These primal acts of bearing burden sparked the transportation revolution. We became mobile storage units, carrying not just objects but possibilities.

The physics is simple: work = force × distance. But carrying transforms this equation into civilization. Each carried object is potential energy, future utility, delayed gratification made portable.

From baskets balanced on heads to backpacks distributing weight ergonomically, carrying technologies multiply human capacity without external power. They're the bridge between biological and mechanical transportation.
