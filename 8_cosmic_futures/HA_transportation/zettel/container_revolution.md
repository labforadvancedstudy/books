# Container Revolution

## Core Insight
The shipping container did for cargo what the bit did for information - created a universal unit of transport that could seamlessly flow between ships, trains, and trucks, making the global economy possible.

Before containers, moving cargo meant moving chaos. Longshoremen manually loaded thousands of individual items. Ships spent more time in port than at sea. Theft was rampant. Damage was expected. The friction of transshipment made global trade expensive and slow.

The container's genius was standardization. One box that fits on ships, trains, and trucks. Suddenly, the entire planet became one integrated transport network. A factory in China could fill a box that would travel sealed to a store in Kansas, untouched by human hands.

This simple metal box created globalization. By reducing transport costs by 90%, containers made it cheaper to manufacture on the other side of the planet than next door. Geography became irrelevant. The container didn't just improve transportation - it erased economic distance.
