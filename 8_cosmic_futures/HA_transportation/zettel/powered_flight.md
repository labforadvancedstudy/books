# Powered Flight Achievement

## Core Insight
Flight wasn't about imitating birds - it was about understanding that air is an ocean we live at the bottom of, and with enough speed, even a barn door will fly.

For millennia, humans tried to fly by copying birds: flapping wings, feathers, lightweight materials. All failed. The Wright brothers succeeded by ignoring biology and embracing physics. They realized flight required three things: lift, thrust, and control.

Their wind tunnel tests revealed the counterintuitive truth: a curved wing moving through air creates pressure differential. Lower pressure above, higher below, and suddenly you're sucked skyward. Add an engine for thrust and control surfaces for stability, and you've cheated gravity.

Powered flight compressed geography more dramatically than any previous transport. The Atlantic went from a weeks-long ordeal to hours. Mountains became irrelevant. Weather became the only geography that mattered. We became three-dimensional.
