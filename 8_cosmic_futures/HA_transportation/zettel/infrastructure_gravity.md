# Infrastructure Gravity

## Core Insight
Transportation infrastructure doesn't just enable movement - it creates gravitational fields that warp economic and social space, pulling human activity into new configurations that persist for centuries.

A road, once built, becomes destiny. Villages form at crossroads. Cities emerge at ports. Industries cluster near rail hubs. The infrastructure we build to move through space ends up determining how we organize space itself.

This is path dependence made physical. Roman roads still define European city locations. Canals dug centuries ago still shape trade routes. Railroad towns that lost their trains became ghost towns. Infrastructure creates its own necessity.

The gravity is so strong it bends time. High-speed rail makes distant cities "closer" than nearby towns without stations. Airports create time-space bubbles where global cities connect more easily with each other than with their own hinterlands. Infrastructure doesn't just serve geography - it creates new geography.
