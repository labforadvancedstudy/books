# Network Emergence

## Core Insight
Transportation networks exhibit emergent intelligence - millions of individual routing decisions create optimal pathways no central planner designed, forming neural patterns across continents that pulse with traffic like thoughts.

Watch traffic from above: morning rush hours pulse outward from suburbs like slow explosions. Evening reverses the flow. Weekends scatter randomly. Holidays create long-distance waves. The network breathes, thinks, responds to invisible stimuli.

These patterns emerge without design. Truckers find efficient routes and share knowledge. Commuters discover shortcuts. Navigation apps aggregate millions of phones' movements. The network teaches itself, optimizing continuously.

This emergent intelligence extends beyond roads. Airline routes create hub-and-spoke patterns maximizing connections. Shipping lanes follow invisible rivers of efficiency across oceans. Rail networks branch like bronchi, bringing life-sustaining commerce to economic cells. Each network evolves its own metabolism.
