# Speed Barriers and Breakthroughs

## Core Insight
Every order of magnitude increase in transportation speed requires a fundamental shift in thinking - from walking to riding (10x), from horses to trains (10x), from trains to planes (10x), each jump demanded new physics.

Speed barriers aren't just technical - they're conceptual. The sound barrier seemed absolute until we realized it was just air's complaint about being pushed too fast. Give air a sharp enough nose cone and smooth acceleration, and it steps aside at Mach 1.

Each speed regime has its own rules:
- Walking speed (5 km/h): Friction dominates
- Horse speed (50 km/h): Wind resistance appears  
- Train speed (200 km/h): Aerodynamics crucial
- Flight speed (900 km/h): Compressibility effects
- Supersonic (Mach 2+): Shock waves rule
- Orbital (28,000 km/h): Gravity is the only law

Breaking each barrier required abandoning previous assumptions. Wheels don't work in air. Wings don't work in space. Progress meant repeatedly realizing that yesterday's solution is today's problem.
