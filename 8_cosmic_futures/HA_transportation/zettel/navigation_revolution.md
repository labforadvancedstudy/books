# Navigation Revolution

## Core Insight
Navigation is the art of knowing where you are in space and time - without it, all transportation technology is just elaborate wandering. The history of navigation is the history of humanity's increasing precision in locating itself in the universe.

Early navigation was biological: following rivers, reading stars, recognizing landmarks. Then came tools that externalized these abilities: maps crystallized spatial memory, compasses pointed always north, sextants measured stellar angles.

The chronometer was as revolutionary as the steam engine. By keeping precise time at sea, navigators could calculate longitude. Suddenly, the featureless ocean became a grid. Ships could find tiny islands in vast waters. Time became location.

GPS represents navigation's apotheosis: satellites broadcasting time signals so precise that relativistic corrections are needed. Your phone calculates position by measuring light-speed delays. We've gone from following rivers to tracking relativistic spacetime distortions. Yet it serves the same need: knowing where we are.
