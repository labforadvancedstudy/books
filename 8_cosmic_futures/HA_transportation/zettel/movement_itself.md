# Movement Itself

## Core Insight
Movement is change of position through spacetime - the most fundamental property that enables all transportation, from quantum tunneling to intergalactic travel.

Before tools, before vehicles, before civilization - there was movement. A bacterium swimming toward nutrients. A seed drifting on wind. A planet orbiting its star. Movement IS life, and life IS movement.

At the quantum level, particles tunnel through barriers they shouldn't cross. At the cosmic level, galaxies race apart. Movement operates at every scale, following deep patterns we've only begun to understand.

Every transportation technology is just a clever way to move faster, farther, or more efficiently than biology alone permits. But the essence remains: changing position in space over time.
