# Mass Transit Paradox

## Core Insight
Mass transit achieves efficiency by sacrificing individual freedom - the tension between collective optimization and personal autonomy defines every society's transportation choices and, deeper, its values.

A bus carrying 50 people uses less fuel per person than 50 cars. A train carrying 500 is even more efficient. From physics and economics perspectives, mass transit is obviously superior. Yet people choose cars whenever they can afford them. Why?

The answer reveals transportation's social dimension. Efficiency isn't everything. Cars offer freedom: go anywhere, anytime, with anyone, carrying anything. Mass transit offers efficiency: go where tracks lead, when schedules permit, with strangers, carrying what you can hold.

This isn't irrational preference but rational valuation of autonomy. The sprawling, inefficient, car-centric city might be thermodynamically insane but psychologically satisfying. Mass transit works when it offers something cars can't: speed (subways beat traffic), convenience (no parking), or experience (scenic trains). Otherwise, people choose freedom over efficiency.
