# Friction: Enemy and Friend

## Core Insight
Friction is transportation's fundamental paradox - we need it to start and stop, but fight it to maintain motion. Every advance in transportation is really a negotiation with friction.

Without friction, we couldn't walk - our feet would find no purchase. Cars couldn't accelerate - tires would spin helplessly. Brakes wouldn't work - we'd slide forever. Friction enables the very control that makes transportation useful.

Yet friction is also the thief of energy. Rolling resistance, air drag, bearing friction - these invisible forces steal momentum and demand constant energy input. The history of transportation efficiency is largely the history of friction reduction: wheels, bearings, streamlining, lubrication, magnetic levitation.

The deepest insight: we don't eliminate friction, we manage it. High friction where we need grip (tires, brake pads), low friction where we need flow (bearings, hulls). Transportation technology is friction choreography - a dance between grip and glide.
