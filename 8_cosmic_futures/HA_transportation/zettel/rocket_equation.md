# The Rocket Equation Tyranny

## Core Insight
The rocket equation reveals the fundamental cruelty of spaceflight: to go faster, you need more fuel, but more fuel means more weight, which needs more fuel - an exponential curse that makes reaching orbit harder than reaching the moon from orbit.

Tsiolkovsky's equation is beautifully simple: Δv = v_e × ln(m_0/m_f). But hidden in that natural logarithm is transportation's harshest mathematics. To reach orbital velocity (7.8 km/s), a rocket must be mostly fuel. To reach escape velocity (11.2 km/s), it must be almost entirely fuel.

This is why rockets are skyscrapers of explosive liquid with a tiny payload on top. A Saturn V was 85% fuel by mass. SpaceX's Starship will be 90%. We're not building vehicles; we're building controlled explosions that happen to carry things.

The rocket equation drove every space innovation: staging (drop empty mass), higher ISP engines (increase exhaust velocity), and now reusability (amortize the non-fuel mass). It's the wall that makes space transportation fundamentally different from every other kind.
