# Walking and Running

## Core Insight
The controlled fall - humanity's first transportation technology, where we learned to throw ourselves forward and catch ourselves with each step.

Walking is so fundamental we forget it's a technology. Bipedalism freed our hands, extended our range, and rewired our brains. Each step is a controlled fall - we lean forward into disequilibrium and rescue ourselves with the next footfall.

Running multiplies this principle. We become projectiles, spending more time airborne than grounded. The human body transforms into a spring-loaded transportation system, storing and releasing elastic energy with each stride.

These gaits that seem so natural took millions of years to evolve. They're marvels of engineering that no robot has truly replicated. Every other transportation method builds on lessons learned from walking and running.
