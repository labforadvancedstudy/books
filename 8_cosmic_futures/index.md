## Future Timeline (Speculative)
- **Now**: Chemical rockets, ISS, Mars rovers
- **20 years**: Moon base, Mars missions
- **50 years**: Asteroid mining, space manufacturing
- **100 years**: Mars colony, fusion rockets
- **200 years**: Solar system colonization
- **500 years**: First interstellar probes
- **1000 years**: Dyson swarm begins
- **2000 years**: Interstellar colonies
- **5000 years**: Stellar engineering
- **10,000 years**: Galactic civilization
- **1M years**: Transcendence?

## The Great Filters
What challenges await?
1. **Getting to orbit cheaply** (almost solved)
2. **Surviving off Earth** (in progress)
3. **Interplanetary travel** (technically solved)
4. **Interstellar travel** (physics problem)
5. **Preserving consciousness** (philosophical problem)
6. **Avoiding self-destruction** (wisdom problem)
7. **Finding/becoming other intelligences** (unknown)

## Why Go to Space?
- **Survival**: Don't keep all eggs in one basket
- **Resources**: Infinite energy and materials
- **Knowledge**: Universe is the ultimate laboratory
- **Transcendence**: Next stage of consciousness evolution

## The Ultimate Questions
- Will consciousness spread through the cosmos?
- Can we build megastructures?
- Will we meet other intelligences?
- Can we transcend physical reality?
- Is the universe itself conscious?
