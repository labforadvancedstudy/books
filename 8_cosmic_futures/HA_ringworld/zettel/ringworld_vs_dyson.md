# Ringworld vs Dyson

## Core Insight
Both capture a star's energy, but Ringworld chooses life over efficiency - the difference reveals everything about the Builders' values.

A Dyson sphere captures 100% of stellar output - ultimate efficiency for post-biological civilizations. Ringworld captures maybe 0.0003% - the tiny slice that intersects its plane. As an energy collector, it's laughably inefficient. As a habitat, it's impossibly generous. The choice speaks volumes.

Dyson spheres are for civilizations that have transcended biology. Upload your consciousness, live in virtual paradise powered by stellar furnaces. Ringworld is for civilizations that choose to remain biological, or create spaces for biological life to flourish. It's not about energy - it's about experience. Not efficiency - but existence.

The Builders could have built Dyson spheres - the technology requirements overlap significantly. They chose rings. They chose inefficiency. They chose to create spaces where biological life could evolve, explore, experience. They chose the messiness of matter over the cleanliness of energy. That choice might be their greatest message.
