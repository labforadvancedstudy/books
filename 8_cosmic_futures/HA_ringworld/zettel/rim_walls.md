# Rim Walls

## Core Insight
Thousand-mile-high walls to keep the air from spilling into space - because even atmosphere obeys centrifugal force.

Ringworld's spin creates outward "gravity," but atmosphere doesn't stick like solid objects. Air molecules at the rim would achieve escape velocity and stream into space, leaving the ring airless in decades. Solution: walls. Thousand-mile-high mountains of scrith running along both rims, containing three million Earths' worth of atmosphere.

The scale defies visualization. These walls are higher than Earth's atmosphere is thick. From the base, you can't see the top - it's beyond the curve of the ring and shrouded in vacuum. They're not built; they're extruded as part of the ring's structure. Unclimbable, unbreachable, absolute.

But rim walls create their own ecology. The base has Earth-normal pressure. Halfway up, it's like Everest's peak. Near the top, pressure approaches zero. Each altitude hosts different life, different physics, different possibilities. The walls meant to contain become vertical worlds hosting their own evolutionary experiments.
