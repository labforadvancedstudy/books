# Evolutionary Laboratory

## Core Insight
Three million Earths of surface area with designed isolation barriers - Ringworld is evolution's ultimate experimental playground.

Each isolated region becomes a test case. Start with the same base species, add different pressures, wait a million years. The ring sections diverge: low gravity adaptations near the rim, high UV resistance under shadow square gaps, aquatic species in the freshwater seas, aerial forms where mountains channel permanent winds. Evolution runs parallel experiments at unprecedented scale.

But Ringworld adds artificial selection pressures. Ancient machinery still operates in some regions - species must adapt to coexist with technology. Radiation from damaged systems creates mutation hotspots. Microgravity zones near massive structures select for different body plans. The ring doesn't just host evolution; it directs it through engineered environments.

The result: more biological diversity than a thousand natural worlds. Species that couldn't evolve on planets thrive here. Ecological niches impossible in nature become dominant strategies. Ringworld isn't just habitat - it's evolution's laboratory, running experiments no planet could sustain.
