# Spill Mountains

## Core Insight
When rivers have no ocean to reach, they pool against the rim walls until physics forces a solution - spillpipes punching through scrith itself.

Ringworld has no oceans - water would pool at the rim under spin gravity. Rivers flow "downward" (outward) until they hit the rim walls, where they'd accumulate until the ring drowned. The Builders' solution: spill mountains. Periodically spaced along the rim, these are vast ramjets where water pressure finally punctures even scrith, creating spillpipes that jet water into space.

The water doesn't escape - it's caught by recycling systems and returned to the ring's ecosystem. But the mountains themselves are monuments to engineering necessity. Each is unique, shaped by millions of years of erosion, surrounded by vast freshwater seas. Civilizations worship them as gods' dwellings, not knowing they're plumbing fixtures.

The poetry: Ringworld's mightiest mountains exist because water must flow. The most impressive features serve the humblest need. Even gods must deal with drainage. Engineering at any scale remains engineering.
