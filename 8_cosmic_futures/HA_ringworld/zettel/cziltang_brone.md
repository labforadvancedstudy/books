# Cziltang Brone

## Core Insight
When atmosphere meets vacuum at 770 miles per second, you get a perpetual hurricane that makes Jupiter's Red Spot look like a summer breeze.

At Ringworld's rim, where the thousand-mile walls meet vacuum, physics gets violent. The atmosphere can't escape but wants to. The spin creates Coriolis forces stronger than any planetary storm. The result: cziltang brone, the "rim hurricane" - a permanent atmospheric feature circling the entire ring at both edges.

Wind speeds exceed sound. Pressure differentials could crush buildings. Temperature gradients spawn tornadoes within hurricanes within the greater storm. It's self-sustaining - the ring's spin provides endless energy, the wall provides endless boundary. No civilization can live near it. No technology can calm it. It's weather as geological feature.

Yet life adapts. Aerial ecosystems evolved in the perpetual winds. Species that live their entire lifecycle airborne, feeding on nutrients swept up from below. Predators that hunt in three dimensions at supersonic speeds. The storm meant to be sterile boundary becomes its own biosphere. Even Ringworld's failures become opportunities for life.
